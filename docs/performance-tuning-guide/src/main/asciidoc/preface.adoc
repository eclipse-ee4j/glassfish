The Performance Tuning Guide describes how to get the best performance
with {productName} 7.

This preface contains information about and conventions for the entire
{productName} ({productName}) documentation set.

{productName} 7 is developed through the GlassFish project
open-source community at `http://glassfish.java.net/`. The GlassFish
project provides a structured process for developing the {productName} platform that makes the new features of the Jakarta EE platform
available faster, while maintaining the most important feature of Java
EE: compatibility. It enables Java developers to access the {productName} source code and to contribute to the development of the {productName}. The GlassFish project is designed to encourage communication
between Oracle engineers and the community.
