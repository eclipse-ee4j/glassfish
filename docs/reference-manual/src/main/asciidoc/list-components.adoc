Lists deployed components

=== Synopsis

[source]
----
asadmin [asadmin-options] list-components [--help]
[--long={false|true}] [--resources] [--subcomponents]
[--type type] [target]
----

=== Description

[NOTE]
====
The `list-components` subcommand is deprecated. Use the
`list-applications` subcommand instead.
====

The `list-components` subcommand lists all deployed Jakarta EE components.

If the `--type` option is not specified, all components are listed. If
the type option is specified, you must specify a type. The possible
types are listed in the Options section in this help page.

If multiple versions of a module or application are deployed, this
subcommand lists all versions. To list which version is enabled, set the
`--long` option to `true`. For more information about module and
application versions, see "link:application-deployment-guide/overview.html#module-and-application-versions[Module and Application
Versions]" in {productName} Application
Deployment Guide.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

=== Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these
  options, see the xref:asadmin.adoc#asadmin[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--long`::
  If `true`, displays whether each module or application listed is
  enabled. The default is `false`.
`--resources`::
  Lists the application-scoped resources for each component. If the
  `--subcomponents` option is also used, lists the application-scoped
  resources for each component within an application.
`--subcomponents`::
  Lists the subcomponents of each component. The subcomponents listed
  depend on the component type. For example, for a Jakarta EE application
  (EAR file), modules are listed. For a web application, servlets and
  JSP pages are listed. For an EJB module, EJB subcomponents are listed.
`--type`::
  Specifies the type of the components that are to be listed. The
  options are as follows:

  * `application`
  * `appclient`
  * `connector`
  * `ejb`
  * `web`
  * `webservice`

+
If no type is specified, all components are listed.

=== Operands

    the default value.
  `domain`;;
