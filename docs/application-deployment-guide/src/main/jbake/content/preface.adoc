[NOTE]
========================================================================

This documentation is part of the Java Enterprise Edition contribution 
to the Eclipse Foundation and is not intended for use in relation to 
Java Enterprise Edition or Orace GlassFish. The documentation is in the 
process of being revised to reflect the new Jakarta EE branding. 
Additional changes will be made as requirements and procedures evolve 
for Jakarta EE. Where applicable, references to Java EE or Java 
Enterprise Edition should be considered references to Jakarta EE. 

Please see the Title page for additional license information.

This Application Deployment Guide describes deployment of applications
and application components to GlassFish Server Open Source Edition, and
includes information about deployment descriptors.

This preface contains information about and conventions for the entire
GlassFish Server Open Source Edition (GlassFish Server) documentation
set.

GlassFish Server 5.0 is developed through the GlassFish project
open-source community at `https://github.com/javaee/glassfish`. The
GlassFish project provides a structured process for developing the
GlassFish Server platform that makes the new features of the Java EE
platform available faster, while maintaining the most important feature
of Java EE: compatibility. It enables Java developers to access the
GlassFish Server source code and to contribute to the development of the
GlassFish Server. The GlassFish project is designed to encourage
communication between Oracle engineers and the community.

The following tutorials explain how to develop Java EE applications:

* https://javaee.github.io/firstcup/[Your First Cup: An Introduction to
the Java EE Platform] (`https://javaee.github.io/firstcup/`). For
beginning Java EE programmers, this short tutorial explains the entire
process for developing a simple enterprise application. The sample
application is a web application that consists of a component that is
based on the Enterprise JavaBeans specification, a JAX-RS web service,
and a JavaServer Faces component for the web front end.
* https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/[The Java EE 8 Tutorial]
(`https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/`). This comprehensive tutorial
explains how to use Java EE 8 platform technologies and APIs to develop
Java EE applications.

Javadoc tool reference documentation for packages that are provided with
GlassFish Server is available as follows.

* The API specification for version 8 of Java EE is located at
`https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/`.
* The API specification for GlassFish Server 5.0, including Java EE 8
platform packages and nonplatform packages that are specific to the
GlassFish Server product, is located at
`https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/documentation`.
