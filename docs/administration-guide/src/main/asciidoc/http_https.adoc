=== About Internet Connectivity

The HTTP service provides functionality for deploying web applications
and for making deployed web applications accessible by Internet clients,
either in a single application server instance or in a cluster of
multiple server instances. HTTP services are provided by two kinds of
related objects: listeners and virtual servers.

For more information about clusters, see the xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#GSHAG[{productName} High Availability Administration Guide].

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<About HTTP Network Listeners>>
* <<About Virtual Servers>>

[[about-http-network-listeners]]

==== About HTTP Network Listeners

An HTTP listener, also known as a network listener, is a listen socket
that has an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a port number, a server
name, and a default virtual server. Each virtual server provides
connections between the server and clients through one or more
listeners. Each listener must have a unique combination of port number
and IP address. For example, an HTTP listener can listen for a host on
all configured IP addresses on a given port by specifying the IP address
0.0.0.0. Alternatively, the listener can specify a unique IP address for
each listener while using the same port.

Because an HTTP listener is a combination of IP address and port number,
you can have multiple HTTP listeners with the same IP address and
different port numbers, or with different IP addresses and the same port
number (if your host was configured to respond to these addresses).
However, if an HTTP listener uses the 0.0.0.0 IP address, which listens
on all IP addresses on a port, you cannot create HTTP listeners for
additional IP addresses that listen on the same port for a specific IP
address. For example, if an HTTP listener uses 0.0.0.0:8080 (all IP
addresses on port 8080), another HTTP listener cannot use 1.2.3.4:8080.
The host running the {productName} typically has access to only one
IP address. HTTP listeners typically use the 0.0.0.0 IP address and
different port numbers, with each port number serving a different
purpose. However, if the host does have access to more than one IP
address, each address can serve a different purpose.

To access a web application deployed on {productName}, use the URL
`http://localhost:8080/` (or `https://localhost:8081/` for a secure
application), along with the context root specified for the web
application.

To access the Administration Console, use the URL
`https://localhost:4848/` or `http://localhost:4848/asadmin/` (console
default context root).

[[about-virtual-servers]]

==== About Virtual Servers

A virtual server, sometimes called a virtual host, is an object that
allows the same physical server to host multiple Internet domain names.
All virtual servers hosted on the same physical server share the IP
address of that physical server. A virtual server associates a domain
name for a server (such as `www.aaa.com`) with the particular server on
which {productName} is running. Each virtual server must be
registered with the DNS server for your network.


[NOTE]
====
Do not confuse an Internet domain with the administrative domain of
{productName}.
====


For example, assume that you want to host the following domains on your
physical server: `www.aaa.com`, `www.bbb.com`, and `www.ccc.com`. Assume
that these domains are respectively associated with web modules `web1`,
`web2`, and `web3`. This means that the following URLs are handled by
your physical server:

[source]
----
http://www.aaa.com:8080/web1
http://www.bbb.com:8080/web2
http://www.ccc.com:8080/web3
----

The first URL is mapped to virtual server `www.aaa.com`, the second URL
is mapped to virtual server `www.bbb.com`, and the third is mapped to
virtual server `www.ccc.com`. For this mapping to work, `www.aaa.com`,
`www.bbb.com`, and `www.ccc.com` must all resolve to your physical
server's IP address and each virtual server must be registered with the
DNS server for your network. In addition, on a UNIX system, add these
domains to your `/etc/hosts` file (if the setting for `hosts` in your
`/etc/nsswitch.conf` file includes `files`).

[[administering-http-network-listeners]]

=== Administering HTTP Network Listeners

By default, when {productName} starts, the following HTTP listeners
are started automatically:

* HTTP listeners associated with the virtual server named `server`:
** The listener named `http-listener-1` does not have security enabled.
** The listener named `http-listener-2` has security enabled.
* An HTTP listener named `admin-listener`, associated with the virtual
server named `__asadmin`. For this listener, security is not enabled.

The following table describes the {productName} default ports for the
listeners that use ports.

[[to-create-an-internet-connection]]

==== To Create an Internet Connection

Use the subcommands in this procedure to create an internet connection
with the full range of listener options. A network listener is created
behind the scenes. For the shortcut version of this process , see
<<To Create an HTTP Network Listener>>.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Create an HTTP or HTTPS protocol by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-protocol[`create-protocol`] subcommand with the
`--securityenabled` option.
To use the built-in `http-listener-1` HTTP protocol,
or `http-listener-2` HTTPS protocol, skip this step.
3. Create an HTTP configuration by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-http[`create-http`] subcommand.
To use a built-in protocol, skip this step.
4. Create a transport by using the xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-transport[`create-transport`]
subcommand. To use the built-in `tcp` transport, skip this step.
5. Create a thread pool by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-threadpool[`create-threadpool`] subcommand.
To avoid using a thread pool, or to use the built-in `http-thread-pool`
thread pool, skip this step.
For additional thread pool information, see xref:threadpools.adoc#administering-thread-pools[Administering Thread Pools].
6. Create an HTTP listener by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-network-listener[`create-network-listener`] subcommand.
Specify a protocol and transport, optionally a thread pool.
7. To apply your changes, restart {productName}. See xref:domains.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart a Domain].

[[administering-virtual-servers]]

=== Administering Virtual Servers

A virtual server is a virtual web server that serves content targeted
for a specific URL. Multiple virtual servers can serve content using the
same or different host names, port numbers, or IP addresses. The HTTP
service directs incoming web requests to different virtual servers based
on the URL.

When you first install {productName}, a default virtual server is
created. You can assign a default virtual server to each new HTTP
listener you create.

Web applications and Jakarta EE applications containing web components (web
modules) can be assigned to virtual servers during deployment. A web
module can be assigned to more than one virtual server, and a virtual
server can have more than one web module assigned to it. If you deploy a
web application and don't specify any assigned virtual servers, the web
application is assigned to all currently defined virtual servers. If you
then create additional virtual servers and want to assign existing web
applications to them, you must redeploy the web applications. For more
information about deployment, see the xref:application-deployment-guide.adoc#GSDPG[{productName} Application Deployment Guide].

You can define virtual server properties using the `asadmin set`
command. For example:

[source]
----
asadmin> set server-config.http-service.virtual-server.MyVS.property.sso-enabled="true"
----

Some virtual server properties can be set for a specific web
application. For details, see "xref:application-deployment-guide.adoc#glassfish-web-app[glassfish-web-app]" in
{productName} Application Deployment Guide.

[[to-create-a-virtual-server]]

==== To Create a Virtual Server

By default, when {productName} starts, the following virtual servers
are started automatically:

* A virtual server named `server`, which hosts all user-defined web
modules.
+
For development, testing, and deployment of web services in a
non-production environment, `server` is often the only virtual server
required.
* A virtual server named `__asadmin`, which hosts all
administration-related web modules (specifically, the Administration
Console). This server is restricted, which means that you cannot deploy
web modules to this virtual server.

In a production environment, additional virtual servers provide hosting
facilities for users and customers so that each appears to have its own
web server, even though there is only one physical server.

Use the `create-virtual-server` subcommand in remote mode to create the
named virtual server.

Before You Begin

A virtual server must specify an existing HTTP listener. Because the
virtual server cannot specify an HTTP listener that is already being
used by another virtual server, create at least one HTTP listener before
creating a new virtual server.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Create a virtual server by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-virtual-server[`create-virtual-server`] subcommand.
+
Information about properties for this subcommand is included in this
help page.
3. To apply your changes, restart {productName}.

[[to-assign-a-default-web-module-to-a-virtual-server]]

==== To Assign a Default Web Module to a Virtual Server

A default web module can be assigned to the default virtual server and
to each new virtual server. To access the default web module for a
virtual server, point the browser to the URL for the virtual server, but
do not supply a context root. For example:

[source]
----
http://myvserver:3184/
----

A virtual server with no default web module assigned serves HTML or
JavaServer Pages ( JSP) content from its document root, which is usually
domain-dir``/docroot``. To access this HTML or JSP content, point your
browser to the URL for the virtual server, do not supply a context root,
but specify the target file.

For example:

[source]
----
http://myvserver:3184/hellothere.jsp

[[to-set-jsessionidsso-cookie-attributes]]

==== To Set `JSESSIONIDSSO` Cookie Attributes

Use the `sso-cookie-http-only` and `sso-cookie-secure` virtual server
attributes to set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` attributes of any
`JSESSIONIDSSO` cookies associated with web applications deployed to the
virtual server.

Use the xref:reference-manual.adoc#set[`set`] subcommand to set the value of the
`sso-cookie-http-only` and `sso-cookie-secure` virtual server
attributes.

The values supported for these attributes are as follows:

`sso-cookie-http-only`::
  A boolean value that specifies whether the `HttpOnly` attribute is
  included in `JSESSIONIDSSO` cookies. When set to `true`, which is the
  default, the `HttpOnly` attribute is included. When set to `false`,
  the `HttpOnly` attribute is not included.
`sso-cookie-secure`::
  A string value that specifies whether the `Secure` attribute is
  included in `JSESSIONIDSSO` cookies. Allowed values are as follows:
+
  * `true` — The `Secure` attribute is included.
  * `false` — The `Secure` attribute is not included.
  * `dynamic` — The `Secure` attribute setting is inherited from the
  first session participating in SSO. This is the default value.
