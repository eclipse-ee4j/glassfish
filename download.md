## Eclipse GlassFish 7.x

Eclipse GlassFish is an application server, implementing [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/about).
This release is corresponding with the [Jakarta EE 10](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10) specification, which is a major feature release.

GlassFish 7.0.25 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs.
It is tested with Java 11, 17 and 21, experimentally can be used also with newer or non LTS version.
MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.
