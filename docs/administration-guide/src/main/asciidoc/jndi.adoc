== 18 Administering the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) Service

The Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API is used for accessing
different kinds of naming and directory services. Jakarta EE components
locate objects by invoking the JNDI lookup method.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<About JNDI>>
* <<Administering JNDI Resources>>

Instructions for accomplishing the tasks in this chapter by using the
Administration Console are contained in the Administration Console
online help.

=== About JNDI

By making calls to the JNDI API, applications locate resources and other
program objects. A resource is a program object that provides
connections to systems, such as database servers and messaging systems.
A JDBC resource is sometimes referred to as a data source. Each resource
object is identified by a unique, people-friendly name, called the JNDI
name. A resource object and its JNDI name are bound together by the
naming and directory service, which is included with the {productName}.

When a new name-object binding is entered into the JNDI, a new resource
is created.

==== Jakarta EE Naming Environment

JNDI names are bound to their objects by the naming and directory
service that is provided by a Jakarta EE server. Because Jakarta EE components
access this service through the JNDI API, the object usually uses its
JNDI name. For example, the JNDI name of the Apache Derby database is
`jdbc/_default`. At startup, the {productName} reads information from
the configuration file and automatically adds JNDI database names to the
name space, one of which is `jdbc/_default`.

Jakarta EE application clients, enterprise beans, and web components must
have access to a JNDI naming environment.

The application component's naming environment is the mechanism that
allows customization of the application component's business logic
during deployment or assembly. This environment allows you to customize
the application component without needing to access or change the source
code off the component. A Jakarta EE container implements the provides the
environment to the application component instance as a JNDI naming
context.

[[how-the-naming-environment-and-the-container-work-together]]

==== How the Naming Environment and the Container Work Together

The application component's environment is used as follows:

* The application component's business methods access the environment
using the JNDI interfaces. In the deployment descriptor, the application
component provider declares all the environment entries that the
application component expects to be provided in its environment at
runtime.
* The container provides an implementation of the JNDI naming context
that stores the application component environment. The container also
provides the tools that allow the deployer to create and manage the
environment of each application component.
* A deployer uses the tools provided by the container to initialize the
environment entries that are declared in the application component's
deployment descriptor. The deployer sets and modifies the values of the
environment entries.
* The container makes the JNDI context available to the application
component instances at runtime. These instances use the JNDI interfaces
to obtain the values of the environment entries.

Each application component defines its own set of environment entries.
All instances of an application component within the same container
share the same environment entries. Application component instances are
not allowed to modify the environment at runtime.

[[naming-references-and-binding-information]]

==== Naming References and Binding Information

A resource reference is an element in a deployment descriptor that
identifies the component's coded name for the resource. For example,
`jdbc/SavingsAccountDB`. More specifically, the coded name references a
connection factory for the resource.

The JNDI name of a resource and the resource reference name are not the
same. This approach to naming requires that you map the two names before
deployment, but it also decouples components from resources. Because of
this decoupling, if at a later time the component needs to access a
different resource, the name does not need to change. This flexibility
makes it easier for you to assemble Jakarta EE applications from
preexisting components.

The following table lists JNDI lookups and their associated resource
references for the Jakarta EE resources used by the {productName}.

[[administering-jndi-resources]]

=== Administering JNDI Resources

Within {productName}, you can configure your environment for custom
and external JNDI resources. A custom resource accesses a local JNDI
repository; an external resource accesses an external JNDI repository.
Both types of resources need user-specified factory class elements, JNDI
name attributes, and so on.

[[to-disable-glassfish-server-v2-vendor-specific-jndi-names]]

===== To Disable {productName} v2 Vendor-Specific JNDI Names

The EJB 3.1 specification supported by {productName} 7 defines
portable EJB JNDI names. Because of this, there is less need to continue
to use older vendor-specific JNDI names.

By default, {productName} v2-specific JNDI names are applied
automatically by {productName} 7 for backward compatibility.
However, this can lead to some ease-of-use issues. For example,
deploying two different applications containing a Remote EJB component
that exposes the same remote interface causes a conflict between the
default JNDI names.

The default handling of v2-specific JNDI names in {productName} 7
can be managed with the `asadmin` command or with the
`disable-nonportable-jndi-names` boolean property for the
`ejb-container` element in `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml`.

Use the `asadmin` command or directly modify the `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml`
file to set the `disable-nonportable-jndi-names` property.

* Using the `asadmin` command:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> set server.ejb-container.property.disable-nonportable-jndi-names="true"
----
* Directly modifying the `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` file.
1. Add the `disable-nonportable-jndi-names` property to the
`ejb-container` element in `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml`.
2. Set the value of the `disable-nonportable-jndi-names` boolean, as
desired.
+
`false` - Enables the automatic use of {productName} v2-specific JNDI
names. This is the default setting.
+
`true` - Disables the automatic use of v2-specific JNDI names. In all
cases, 5.0-compatible JNDI names will be used.
3. Save the `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` file and restart the {productName} domain.
+
This setting applies to all EJBs deployed to the server.
