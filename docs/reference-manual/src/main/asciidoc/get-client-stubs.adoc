== get-client-stubs

Retrieves the application JAR files needed to launch the application
client.

=== Synopsis

[source]
----
asadmin [asadmin-options] get-client-stubs [--help]
--appname application_name
local_directory_path
----

=== Description

The `get-client-stubs` subcommand copies the required JAR files for an
`AppClient` standalone module or each `AppClient` module in an
application from the server machine to the local directory. Each
client's generated JAR file is retrieved, along with any required
supporting JAR files . The client JAR file name is of the form
app-name`Client.jar`. Before executing the `get-client-stubs`
subcommand, you must deploy the application or module. The generated
client JAR file is useful for running the application using the
`appclient` utility. This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

=== Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these
  options, see the xref:asadmin.adoc#asadmin[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--appname`::
  The name of the application or stand-alone client module. +
  The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows the
  name and is separated from the name by a colon (`:`). The version
  identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain
  alphanumeric characters plus underscore (`_`), dash (`-`), and period
  (`.`) characters. For more information about module and application
  versions, see "xref:application-deployment-guide.adoc#module-and-application-versions[
  Module and Application Versions]" in
  {productName} Application Deployment Guide.

=== Operands

  The path to the local directory where the client stub JAR file should
  be stored.
