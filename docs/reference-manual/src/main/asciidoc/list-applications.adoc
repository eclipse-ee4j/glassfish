Lists deployed applications

=== Synopsis

[source]
----
asadmin [asadmin-options] list-applications [--help]
[--long={false|true}] [--resources] [--subcomponents]
[--type type] [target]
----

=== Description

The `list-applications` subcommand lists deployed Jakarta EE applications
and the type of each application that is listed.

If the `--type` option is not specified, all applications are listed. If
the type option is specified, you must specify a type. The possible
types are listed in the Options section of this help page.

If multiple versions of a module or application are deployed, this
subcommand lists all versions. To list which version is enabled, set the
`--long` option to `true`. For more information about module and
application versions, see "xref:application-deployment-guide.adoc#module-and-application-versions[Module and Application
Versions]" in {productName} Application
Deployment Guide.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

`--long`::

  depend on the application type. For example, for a Jakarta EE application
