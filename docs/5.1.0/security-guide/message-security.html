<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message security enables a server to perform end-to-end authentication
of web service invocations and responses at the message layer. Security
information is inserted into messages so that it travels through the
networking layers and arrives with the intact message at the message
destination(s). Message security differs from transport layer security
in that message security can be used to decouple message protection from
message transport so that messages remain protected after transmission.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Web services deployed on GlassFish Server are secured by binding SOAP
layer message security providers and message protection policies to the
containers in which the applications are deployed, or to web service
endpoints served by the applications. SOAP layer message security
functionality is configured in the client-side containers of GlassFish
Server by binding SOAP layer message security providers and message
protection policies to the client containers or to the portable service
references declared by client applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message-level security can be configured for the entire GlassFish Server
or for specific applications or methods. Configuring message security at
the application level is discussed in the <a href="../application-development-guide/toc.html#GSDVG">GlassFish Server
Open Source Edition Application Development Guide</a>.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_security_tokens_and_security_mechanisms">Security Tokens and Security Mechanisms</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WS-Security is a specification that provides a communications protocol
for applying security to web services. The security mechanisms implement
the specification. Web Services Interoperability Technologies (WSIT)
implements WS-Security so as to provide interoperable message content
integrity and confidentiality, even when messages pass through
intermediary nodes before reaching their destination endpoint.
WS-Security as provided by WSIT is in addition to existing
transport-level security, which can still be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) layer message security
providers installed with GlassFish Server can be used to employ
username/password and X.509 certificate security tokens to authenticate
and encrypt SOAP web services messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Username Tokens. GlassFish Server uses username tokens in SOAP
messages to authenticate the message sender. The recipient of a message
containing a username token (within embedded password) validates that
the message sender is authorized to act as the user (identified in the
token) by confirming that the sender knows the password of the user.<br>
When using a username token, a valid user database must be configured on
GlassFish Server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital Signatures. GlassFish Server uses XML digital signatures to
bind an authentication identity to message content. Clients use digital
signatures to establish their caller identity. Digital signatures are
verified by the message receiver to authenticate the source of the
message content (which might be different from the sender of the
message.)<br>
When using digital signatures, valid keystore and truststore files must
be configured on GlassFish Server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encryption. The purpose of encryption is to modify the data so that it
can only be understood by its intended audience. This is accomplished by
substituting an encrypted element for the original content. When based
on public key cryptography, encryption can be used to establish the
identity of the parties who are authorized to read a message.<br>
When using encryption, a Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) provider that
supports encryption must be installed.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_authentication_providers">Authentication Providers</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The authentication layer is the message layer on which authentication
processing must be performed. GlassFish Server enforces web services
message security at the SOAP layer. The types of authentication that are
supported include the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sender authentication, including username-password authentication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content authentication, including XML digital signatures</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GlassFish Server invokes authentication providers to process SOAP
message layer security. The message security providers provide
information such as the type of authentication that is required for the
request and response messages. The following message security providers
are included with GlassFish Server:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-side Provider. A client-side provider establishes (by signature
or username/password) the source identity of request messages and/or
protects (by encryption) request messages such that they can only be
viewed by their intended recipients. A client-side provider also
establishes its container as an authorized recipient of a received
response (by successfully decrypting it) and validates passwords or
signatures in the response to authenticate the source identity
associated with the response. Client-side providers configured in
GlassFish Server can be used to protect the request messages sent and
the response messages received by server-side components (servlets and
EJB components) acting as clients of other services.<br>
The default client provider is used to identify the client—side provider
to be invoked for any application for which a specific client provider
has not been bound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-side Provider. A server-side provider establishes its container
as an authorized recipient of a received request (by successfully
decrypting it), and validates passwords or signatures in the request to
authenticate the source identity associated with the request. A
server-side provider also establishes (by signature or
username/password) the source identity of response messages and/or
protects (by encryption) response messages such that they can only be
viewed by their intended recipients. Server-side providers are only
invoked by server-side containers.</p>
</li>

<h4 id="_message_protection_policies">Message Protection Policies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A request policy defines the authentication policy requirements
associated with request processing performed by the authentication
provider. Policies are expressed in message sender order such that a
requirement that encryption occur after content would mean that the
message receiver would expect to decrypt the message before validating
the signature. The response policy defines the authentication policy
requirements associated with response processing performed by the
authentication provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message protection policies are defined for request message processing
and response message processing. The policies are expressed in terms of
requirements for source and/or recipient authentication. The providers
apply specific message security mechanisms to cause the message
protection policies to be realized in the context of SOAP web services
messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Source Authentication Policy. A source authentication policy
represents a requirement that the identity of the entity that sent a
message or that defined the content of a message be established in the
message such that it can be authenticated by the message receiver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recipient Authentication Policy. A recipient authentication policy
represents a requirement that the message be sent such that the identity
of the entities that can receive the message can be established by the
message sender.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Request and response message protection policies are defined when a
security provider is configured into a container. Application-specific
message protection policies (at the granularity of the web service port
or operation) can also be configured within the GlassFish Server
deployment descriptors of the application or application client. In any
situation where message protection policies are defined, the request and
response message protection policies of the client must be equivalent t)
the request and response message protection policies of the server. For
more information about defining application-specific message protection
policies, see "<a href="../application-development-guide/securing-apps.html#GSDVG00006">Securing Applications</a>" in GlassFish

<p>Application-specific web services security functionality is configured
(at application assembly) by defining the <code>message-security-binding</code>
elements in the GlassFish Server deployment descriptors of the

GlassFish Server, where they are available for binding for use by the
containers, or by individual applications or clients deployed in the
containers. During installation, the default providers are configured
with a simple message protection policy that, if bound to a container,
or to an application or client in a container, would cause the source of
the content in all request and response messages to be authenticated by
XML digital signature.</p>
