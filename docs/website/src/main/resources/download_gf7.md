## Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.21

Eclipse GlassFish is an application server, implementing Jakarta EE. This release is corresponding with the Jakarta EE 10 specification, which is a major new feature release. Jakarta EE 10 requires JDK 11 as a minimum, but also works on JDK 17 and JDK 21.

GlassFish 7.0.21 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs. It compiles and runs on JDK 11 to JDK 23. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.

This release was all about hunting down a few nasty bugs reported by GlassFish users: restart hanging on fast machines (including ephemeral ports appearing when stopping GlassFish), random 403 responses for authenticated sessions and Faces that was failing to initialize on GlassFish embedded. We're proud to announce that after a lot of research and a lot of work, we were able to squash them all. A special thanks to our users for reporting these and helping us to narrow them down!

### GlassFish 7.0.16

GlassFish 7.0.16 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs. It compiles and runs on JDK 11 to JDK 21. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.

GlassFish 7.0.16 compiles and passes all internal tests using OpenJDK 21. The Jakarta EE 10 TCKs passed on JDK 21 as well. The Jakarta EE 10 TCK as a whole is now also JDK 21 compatible and it's possible to run all the Jakarta EE TCK tests.

In this summer 2024 release of GlassFish we added several new features. Specifically new is an admin command logger, which logs graphical interactions with the admin UI for usage in scripts. GlassFish now also allows resource references in persistence.xml, and we added a great new feature where we are creating temporary snapshots of the external application libraries during application startup, so any update of these is not longer system dependent. We also did a major refactoring of the aging TLS code and optimized the GJULE logging.

This release features among others an important NPE fix for the SSHLauncher and is highly recommended for our users who make use of this launcher.

The thread safety of transactions was improved, and the JDBC connection pool sizing logic was also improved, fixing an annoying bug.

To maintain future quality of GlassFish, many fixes to the internal TCKs tests were done.

As a new feature, command completion is now enabled in the OSGi interactive console.

In the release for this month we replaced many synchronized blocks by reentrant locks (to accommodate JDK 21 virtual threads).

We also looked at SSO between clusters, and fixed a long standing bug there.

A long running investigation into potential resource leaks finally came to a conclusion, and resulted in many fixes throughout the code base. The admin console also saw various improvements, specifically with respect to loading.

GlassFish 7.0.12 compiles and passes all internal tests using OpenJDK 21. Several Jakarta EE 10 TCKs passed on JDK 21 as well. The Jakarta EE 10 TCK as a whole is not JDK 21 compatible and it's not possible to run all the Jakarta EE TCK tests.

This release we focused on finding and fixing the root cause of several "strange" WebSocket related bugs that we witnessed in the past. We also did a similar thing related to several issues with running apps on the default context root, especially where after authentication redirects happened to another URL.

Furthermore we looked into problems with authentication and SSO in a cluster and did some initial fixes. Handling and processing of logging was looked at once again, something we have been improving a lot step by step through various iterations of releases.

Finally but not least a nasty ConcurrentModificationException was fixed, and a memory leak (via HK2) was solved.

This release sees an important fix where WebSockets would not work at all for applications on the default context root (e.g. https://example.com vs https://example.com/myapp).

This month we have concentrated on the AdminGUI and fixed an assortment of small but annoying defects in it. Various major components were updated, such as Jersey (Jakarta REST), Tyrus (Jakarta WebSockets) and Mojarra (Jakarta Faces).

To keep the project maintainable and well tested, several tests were added and improved as well.

### GlassFish 7.0.10

GlassFish 7.0.10 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs. It compiles and runs on JDK 11 to JDK 21. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.

This release is the second GlassFish release after OpenJDK 21 was released. GlassFish 7.0.10 compiles and passes all internal tests using OpenJDK 21. Several Jakarta EE 10 TCKs passed on JDK 21 as well. The Jakarta EE 10 TCK as a whole is not JDK 21 compatible and it's not possible to run all the Jakarta EE TCK tests.

In this release a 10 months long operation to get an internal dependency to the slf4j-api removed finally got to fruition. This involved the intense cooperation of multiple teams, and we're exceptionally happy to have finally been able to do this.

We also did a lot of work to make our builds repeatable, and we did a ton of refactoring to the internal security packages of GlassFish, making them easier to understand and therefore easier to maintain. Any external code depending on these internal packages (such as potentially custom LoginModules/Realms) may have to update (we recommend of course not depending on internal packages and using public APIs).

As every release, we integrated many component updates, and did a number of smaller fixes.

### GlassFish 7.0.9

GlassFish 7.0.9 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs. It compiles and runs on JDK 11 to JDK 21. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.

This release is the first GlassFish release after OpenJDK 21 was released. GlassFish 7.0.9 compiles and passes all internal tests using OpenJDK 21.

In this release the modularity of GlassFish is once again increased by moving the Jakarta Authentication implementation code to a new standalone project: [Epicyro](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/epicyro). We also enabled the GlassFish embedded tests again, which were dormant for a long time. Among the many updated components, Exousia was updated specifically to fix a bug with deployments on virtual servers, and the ORB was updated to fix a somewhat obscure bug where a remote EJB returned a JDK defined enum type.

This release fixes multi-jar compatibility in GlassFish and does further preparations for JDK 21. It includes various component updates among which those for CDI, Faces, and JSON. Test coverage is improved by adding the TCKs for REST Client and Connectors. Finally, various CDI extensions have been optimised to reduce excessive and unnecessary calls to them.
