<div class="paragraph">
<p>Security is about protecting data, that is, how to prevent unauthorized
access or damage to data that is in storage or in transit. The GlassFish
Server is built on the Java security model, which uses a sandbox where
applications can run safely, without potential risk to systems or users.
System security affects all the applications in the GlassFish Server
environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Java EE Security API specification defines portable, plug-in
interfaces for authentication and identity stores, and a new
injectable-type SecurityContext interface that provides an access point
for programmatic security. You can use the built-in implementations of
the plug-in SPIs, or write custom implementations.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_authentication">Authentication</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Authentication is the way in which an entity (a user, an application, or
a component) determines that another entity is who it claims to be. An
entity uses security credentials to authenticate itself. The credentials
might be a user name and password, a digital certificate, or something
else. Usually, servers or applications require clients to authenticate
themselves. Additionally, clients might require servers to authenticate
themselves. When authentication is bidirectional, it is called mutual
authentication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an entity tries to access a protected resource, GlassFish Server
uses the authentication mechanism configured for that resource to
determine whether to grant access. For example, a user can enter a user
name and password in a web browser, and if the application verifies
those credentials, the user is authenticated. The user is associated
with this authenticated security identity for the remainder of the
session.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_authentication_types">Authentication Types</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within its deployment descriptors, an application can specify the type
of authentication that it uses. The Java EE Security API provides an
alternative mechanism for configuring the type of authentication an
application uses. See <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=375">Java EE
Security API 1.0 specification</a>. GlassFish Server supports specifying
the following types of authentication in deployment descriptors:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">BASIC</dt>
<dd>
<p>Uses the standard Basic Authentication Scheme as described in RFC</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The communication protocol is HTTP (SSL optional). There is no
encryption of user credentials unless using SSL. This type is not
considered to be a secure method of user authentication unless used in
conjunction with an encrypted communications channel, such as that
provided by SSL.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">FORM</dt>
<dd>
<p>The application provides its own custom login and error pages. The
communication protocol is HTTP (SSL optional). There is no encryption
of user credentials unless using SSL.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">CLIENT-CERT</dt>
<dd>
<p>The server authenticates the client using a public key certificate.
The communication protocol is HTTPS (HTTP over SSL).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">DIGEST</dt>
<dd>
<p>The server authenticates a user based on a user name and a password.
Unlike BASIC authentication, the plaintext password is never sent over
the network, although a hash of the password combined with other
parameters is sent. While Digest Authentication is more secure than
Basic Authentication, user names and passwords are not strongly
protected, and the use of SSL is still recommended.</p>

<h5 id="_jsr_375_authentication_mechanisms_and_identity_stores">JSR 375 Authentication Mechanisms and Identity Stores</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Java EE Security API defines the <code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code>
interface, the <code>IdentityStore</code> and <code>IdentityStoreHandler</code> interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code> interface defines an SPI for writing
authentication mechanisms that can be provided with an application and
deployed using CDI. Developers can write their own implementations of
<code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code> to support specific authentication token
types or protocols. There are also several built-in authentication
mechanisms that perform BASIC, FORM, and Custom FORM authentication.The
<code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code> interface defines three methods -
<code>validateRequest()</code>, <code>secureResponse()</code>, and <code>cleanSubject()</code>. These
methods align closely with the methods defined by the JASPIC
<code>ServerAuth</code> interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>IdentityStore</code> interface provides an abstraction of an identity
store that holds user account information including name, password,
group membership, and potentially other attributes. Implementations of
the <code>IdentityStore</code> interface are used to validate caller credentials,
typically username and password, and retrieve and group information.
There are built-in implementations of this SPI that can validate
credentials against external LDAP or Database identity stores.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>IdentityStore</code> is intended primarily for use by
<code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code> implementations, but could be used by
other authentication mechanisms, such as a JASPIC <code>ServerAuthModule</code>, or
a container&#8217;s built-in authentication mechanisms. Though
<code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code> implementations can authenticate users in
any manner they choose, the <code>IdentityStore</code> interface provides a
convenient mechanism. A significant advantage of using
<code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code> and <code>IdentityStore</code> over the declarative
mechanisms defined by the Servlet specification is that it allows an
application to control the identity stores that it authenticates
against, in a standard, portable way. You can use the built-in
implementations of the  plug-in SPIs, or define custom implementations.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>JSR 196 defines a standard service-provider interface (SPI) for

of message authentication modules in message processing runtimes. The

<p>Master Password and Keystores</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The master password is not tied to a user account and it is not used for
authentication. Instead, GlassFish Server uses the master password only
to encrypt the keystore and truststore for the DAS and instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you create a new GlassFish Server domain, a new self-signed
certificate is generated and stored in the domain keystore and
truststore. The DAS needs the master password to open these stores at
startup. Similarly, the associated server instances need the master
password to open their copy of these stores at startup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you use a utility such as keytool to modify the keystore or
truststore, you must provide the master password in that case as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The master password is a shared password and must be the same for the
DAS and all instances in the domain in order to manage the instances
from the DAS. However, because GlassFish Server never transmits the
master password over the network, it is up to you to keep the master
password in sync between the DAS and instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you change the master password, you can choose to enter the master
password manually when required, or save it in a file.</p>

<p>Understanding Master Password Synchronization</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The master password is used encrypt the keystore and truststore for the
DAS and instances. The DAS needs the master password to open these
stores at startup. Similarly, the associated server instances need the
master password to open their copy of these stores at startup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GlassFish Server keeps the keystore and truststore for the DAS and
instances in sync, which guarantees that all copies of the stores are
encrypted with the same master password at any given time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, GlassFish Server does not synchronize the master password
itself, and it is possible that the DAS and instances might attempt to
use different master passwords.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider the following potential scenario:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>You create a domain and instances, using the default master password
(changeit). As a result, the DAS and instances have keystores and
truststores encrypted using changeit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You use the <code>change-master-password</code> subcommand on the DAS to change
the master password to ichangedit. As a result, the DAS and instance
keystores and truststores are encrypted using ichangedit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to the keystore and truststore from an instance now requires
the master password ichangedit. You are responsible for changing the
master password as needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do not use a master password file, you assume the responsibility
for using the <code>change-master-password</code> subcommand on the DAS and

a master password file has additional considerations for the
start-instance and start-cluster subcommands, as described in

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a domain, the master password is kept in
domain-dir`/master-password`.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a node, the master-password file is kept in

at the node level and all instances created on that node will use that
master-password file. To do this, use the <code>--nodedir</code> option and provide
a node name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might want to save the master password to the file so that the
<code>start-domain</code> subcommand can start the server without having to prompt
the user. There are additional considerations for using a master

<p>Most web browsers can save login credentials entered through HTML forms.
This function can be configured by the user and also by applications
that employ user credentials. If the function is enabled, then
credentials entered by the user are stored on their local computer and
retrieved by the browser on future visits to the same application. This
function is convenient for users, but can also be a security risk. The
stored credentials can be captured by an attacker who gains access to
the computer, either locally or through some remote compromise. Further,
methods have existed whereby a malicious web site can retrieve the

<h5 id="_roles">Roles</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A role defines which applications and what parts of each application
users can access and what those users or groups can do with the
applications. For example, in a personnel application, all employees
might be able to see phone numbers and email addresses, but only
managers have access to salary information. This application would
define at least two roles: <code>employee</code> and <code>manager</code>. Only users in the
<code>manager</code> role are allowed to view salary information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A role is different from a group in that a role defines a function in an
application, while a group is a set of users who are related in some
way. For example, the personnel application specify groups such as
<code>full-time</code>, <code>part-time</code>, and <code>on-leave</code>. Users in these groups are all
employees (the <code>employee</code> role). In addition, each user has its own
designation that defines an additional level of employment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Roles are defined in the deployment descriptor for the application. The
application developer or deployer maps roles to one or more groups in
the deployment descriptor for each application. When the application is
being packaged and deployed, the application specifies mappings between
users, groups, and roles, as illustrated in <a href="#fxjfw">Figure 1-1</a>.</p>

<h5 id="_certificates">Certificates</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Certificates, also called digital certificates, are electronic files
that uniquely identify people and resources on the Internet.
Certificates also enable secure, confidential communication between two
entities. There are different kinds of certificates:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Personal certificates are used by individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server certificates are used to establish secure sessions between the
server and clients through secure sockets layer (SSL) technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Certificates are based on public key cryptography, which uses pairs of
digital keys (very long numbers) to encrypt, or encode, information so
the information can be read only by its intended recipient. The
recipient then decrypts (decodes) the information to read it. A key pair
contains a public key and a private key. The owner distributes the
public key and makes it available to anyone. But the owner never
distributes the private key, which is always kept secret. Because the
keys are mathematically related, data encrypted with one key can only be
decrypted with the other key in the pair.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Certificates are issued by a trusted third party called a Certification
Authority (CA). The CA is analogous to a passport office: it validates
the certificate holder&#8217;s identity and signs the certificate so that it
cannot be forged or tampered with. After a CA has signed a certificate,
the holder can present it as proof of identity and to establish
encrypted, confidential communications. Most importantly, a certificate
binds the owner&#8217;s public key to the owner&#8217;s identity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the public key, a certificate typically includes
information such as the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The name of the holder and other identification, such as the URL of
the web server using the certificate, or an individual&#8217;s email address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name of the CA that issued the certificate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An expiration date</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Certificates are governed by the technical specifications of the X.509
format. To verify the identity of a user in the <code>certificate</code> realm, the
authentication service verifies an X.509 certificate, using the common
name field of the X.509 certificate as the principal name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_certificate_chains">Certificate Chains</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A certificate chain is a series of certificates issued by successive CA
certificates, eventually ending in a root CA certificate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Web browsers are preconfigured with a set of root CA certificates that
the browser automatically trusts. Any certificates from elsewhere must
come with a certificate chain to verify their validity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a certificate is first generated, it is a self-signed certificate.
A self-signed certificate is one for which the issuer (signer) is the
same as the subject (the entity whose public key is being authenticated
by the certificate). When the owner sends a certificate signing request
(CSR) to a CA, then imports the response, the self-signed certificate is
replaced by a chain of certificates. At the bottom of the chain is the
certificate (reply) issued by the CA authenticating the subject&#8217;s public
key. The next certificate in the chain is one that authenticates the
CA&#8217;s public key. Usually, this is a self-signed certificate (that is, a
certificate from the CA authenticating its own public key) and the last
certificate in the chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other cases, the CA can return a chain of certificates. In this
situation, the bottom certificate in the chain is the same (a
certificate signed by the CA, authenticating the public key of the key
entry), but the second certificate in the chain is a certificate signed
by a different CA, authenticating the public key of the CA to which you
sent the CSR. Then, the next certificate in the chain is a certificate
authenticating the second CA&#8217;s key, and so on, until a self-signed root
certificate is reached. Each certificate in the chain (after the first)
thus authenticates the public key of the signer of the previous
certificate in the chain.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_certificate_files">Certificate Files</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During GlassFish Server installation, a certificate is generated in Java
Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) format suitable for internal testing.
(The certificate is self-signed.) By default, GlassFish Server stores
its certificate information in certificate databases in the
domain-dir`/config` directory:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Keystore file</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>keystore.jks</code> file contains GlassFish Server certificate,
including its private key. The keystore file is protected with a
password.<br>
Each keystore entry has a unique alias. After installation, the
GlassFish Server keystore has a single entry with an alias of <code>s1as</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Truststore file</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>cacerts.jks</code> file contains the GlassFish Server trusted
certificates, including public keys for other entities. For a trusted
certificate, the server has confirmed that the public key in the
certificate belongs to the certificate&#8217;s owner. Trusted certificates
generally include those of CAs.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, GlassFish Server is configured with a keystore and
truststore that will work with the example applications and for

<h5 id="_secure_sockets_layer">Secure Sockets Layer</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the most popular standard for securing
Internet communications and transactions. Secure web applications use
HTTPS (HTTP over SSL). The HTTPS protocol uses certificates to ensure
confidential and secure communications between server and clients. In an
SSL connection, both the client and the server encrypt data before
sending it. Data is decrypted upon receipt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a Web browser (client) wants to connect to a secure site, an SSL
handshake happens, like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The browser sends a message over the network requesting a secure
session (typically, by requesting a URL that begins with <code>https</code> instead
of <code>http</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server responds by sending its certificate (including its public
key).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The browser verifies that the server&#8217;s certificate is valid and is
signed by a CA whose certificate is in the browser&#8217;s database (and who
is trusted). It also verifies that the CA certificate has not expired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the certificate is valid, the browser generates a one time,
unique session key and encrypts it with the server&#8217;s public key. The
browser then sends the encrypted session key to the server so that they
both have a copy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server decrypts the message using its private key and recovers
the session key.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the handshake, the client has verified the identity of the Web
site, and only the client and the Web server have a copy of the session
key. From this point forward, the client and the server use the session
key to encrypt all their communications with each other. Thus, their
communications are ensured to be secure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The newest version of the SSL standard is called Transport Layer
Security (TLS). The GlassFish Server supports the SSL 3.0 and the TLS
1.0 encryption protocols.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use SSL, GlassFish Server must have a certificate for each external
interface or IP address that accepts secure connections. The HTTPS
service of most web servers will not run unless a certificate has been
installed. For instructions on applying SSL to HTTP listeners, see
"<a href="../administration-guide/http_https.html#GSADG00469">To Configure an HTTP Listener for SSL</a>" in GlassFish

<p>Ciphers</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A cipher is a cryptographic algorithm used for encryption or decryption.
SSL and TLS protocols support a variety of ciphers used to authenticate
the server and client to each other, transmit certificates, and
establish session keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some ciphers are stronger and more secure than others. Clients and
servers can support different cipher suites. During a secure connection,
the client and the server agree to use the strongest cipher that they
both have enabled for communication, so it is usually sufficient to
enable all ciphers.</p>

<p>Name-based Virtual Hosts</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using name-based virtual hosts for a secure application can be
problematic. This is a design limitation of the SSL protocol itself. The
SSL handshake, where the client browser accepts the server certificate,
must occur before the HTTP request is accessed. As a result, the request
information containing the virtual host name cannot be determined prior
to authentication, and it is therefore not possible to assign multiple
certificates to a single IP address.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If all virtual hosts on a single IP address need to authenticate against
the same certificate, the addition of multiple virtual hosts probably
will not interfere with normal SSL operations on the server. Be aware,
however, that most browsers will compare the server&#8217;s domain name
against the domain name listed in the certificate, if any (applicable
primarily to official, CA-signed certificates). If the domain names do
not match, these browsers display a warning. In general, only
address-based virtual hosts are commonly used with SSL in a production
environment.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to administer passwords. You can rely on
administrators to keep passwords secret and change the passwords
regularly. You can set up files for storing passwords so that <code>asadmin</code>

sensitive passwords are not visible in the <code>domain.xml</code> file.</p>

obscure the password in a password file. If there is no password file,
you are prompted for the master password. If there is a password file,

default master password is <code>changeit</code>.</p>

<p>If you change the master password for DAS, the <code>start-domain</code> and

or instance startup in one of three ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Via the master-password file</p>
</li>
<li>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>start-instance</code> and <code>start-cluster</code> subcommands are more
problematic. If you create a domain with a master password other than
the default, an associated remote instance or cluster must have access
to the master password in order to start. However, for security reasons
GlassFish Server never transmits the master password or the master
password file over the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">

<p>Change the master password on the DAS and save it with

</li>

<li>
<p>Try to start the instance using the <code>start-instance</code> subcommand. An

</ol>
</div>

Remember that when you created the domain you specified a new master
password. This master password was then used to encrypt the keystore and
truststore for the DAS, and these stores were copied to the instance as
a result of the <code>create-instance</code> subcommand.<br>
Therefore, enter the master password you set when you created the domain
as both the current master password and again as the new master
password. You enter it as the new master password because you do not
want to change the master password for the instance and make it out of
sync with the DAS.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A password alias is used to indirectly access a password so that the
password itself does not appear in cleartext in the domain&#8217;s
<code>domain.xml</code> configuration file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Storing passwords in cleartext format in system configuration files is
common in many open source projects. In addition to GlassFish Server,
Apache Tomcat, Maven, and Subversion, among others, store and pass
passwords in cleartext format. However, storing and passing passwords in
cleartext can be a security risk, and may violate some corporate
security policies. In such cases, you can use password aliases.</p>

<h5 id="_to_create_a_password_alias">To Create a Password Alias</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use the <code>create-password-alias</code> subcommand in remote mode to create an
alias for a password in the domain&#8217;s keystore. The password
corresponding to the alias name is stored in an encrypted form in the
domain configuration file. The <code>create-password-alias</code> subcommand takes
both a secure interactive form, in which users are prompted for all
information, and a more script-friendly form, in which the password is
propagated on the command line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also use the <a href="../reference-manual/set.html#GSRFM00226"><code>set</code></a> subcommand to remove and
replace the password in the configuration file. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">asadmin set --user admin server.jms-service.jms-host.default_JMS_host.

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Ensure that the server is running.<br>
Remote subcommands require a running server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to the directory where the configuration file resides.<br>
By default, the configuration file is located in domain-dir`/config`.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the password alias by using the
<a href="../reference-manual/create-password-alias.html#GSRFM00049"><code>create-password-alias</code></a> subcommand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type the password for the alias when prompted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the alias to a password file.<br>
For example, assume the use of a password file such as <code>passwords.txt</code>.
Assume further that you want to add an alias for the
<code>AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD</code> entry that is read by the
<a href="../reference-manual/create-file-user.html#GSRFM00024"><code>create-file-user</code></a> subcommand. You would add the
following line to the password file:
`AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD=${ALIAS=`user-password-alias}, where
user-password-alias is the new password alias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To continue the example of the previous step, you would then run the
<a href="../reference-manual/create-file-user.html#GSRFM00024"><code>create-file-user</code></a> subcommand.<br>
You could use this method to create several users (user1, user2, and so
forth), all with the same password.<br>
<code>asadmin&gt;</code> <code>--passwordfile``passwords.txt create-file-user</code> user1</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>After creating a certificate, the owner must sign the certificate to
prevent forgery. E-commerce sites, or those for which authentication of
identity is important, can purchase a certificate from a well-known
Certificate Authority (CA).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>where &lt;store_passwd&gt; is the password for the keystore. For example,
"mypass". Note that <code>s1as</code> is the default alias of the GlassFish Server
keystore.
2.  Generate a new key pair for the application server:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">keytool -genkeypair -keyalg &lt;key_alg&gt; -keystore keystore.jks
-validity &lt;val_days&gt; -alias s1as</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where &lt;key_alg&gt; is the algorithm to be used for generating the key pair,
for example RSA, and &lt;val_days&gt; is the number of days that the
certificate should be considered valid. For example, 365.<br>
In addition to generating a key pair, the command wraps the public key
into a self-signed certificate and stores the certificate and the
private key in a new keystore entry identified by the alias.<br>
For HTTPS hostname verification, it is important to ensure that the name
of the certificate (CN) matches the fully-qualified hostname of your
site (fully-qualified domain name). If the names do not match, clients
connecting to the server will see a security alert stating that the name
of the certificate does not match the name of the site.
3.  Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):<br></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">keytool -certreq -alias s1as -file &lt;certreq_file&gt; -keystore keystore.jks
-storepass &lt;store_passwd&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where &lt;certreq_file&gt; is the file in which the CSR is stored (for
example, <code>s1as.csr</code>) and &lt;store_passwd&gt; is the password for the
keystore. For example, changeit.
4.  Submit the CSR to a Certificate Authority such as VeriSign (at
<code>http://www.verisign.com/ssl/buy-ssl-certificates/index.html</code>). In
response, you should receive a signed server certificate. Make sure to
import into your browser the CA certificate of the CA (if not already
present) and any intermediate certificates indicated by the CA in the
reply.
5.  Store the signed server certificate from the CA, including the
markers <code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----</code> and <code>-----END CERTIFICATE-----</code>,
into a file such as <code>s1as.cert</code>. Download the CA certificate and any
intermediate CA certificates and store them in local files.
6.  Import the CA certificate (if not already present) and any
intermediate CA certificates (if not already present) indicated by the
CA into the truststore <code>cacerts.jks</code>:<br></p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias &lt;CA-Name&gt; -file ca.cert

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias s1as -file s1as.cert

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you import the certificate using the same original alias`s1as`,
keytool treats it as a command to replace the original certificate with
the certificate obtained as a reply to a CSR.<br>
After running the command, you should see that the certificate <code>s1as</code> in
the keystore is no longer the original self-signed certificate, but is
now the response certificate from the CA.<br>
Consider the following example that compares an original <code>s1as</code>
certificate with a new <code>s1as</code> certificate obtained from VeriSign:<br></p>
