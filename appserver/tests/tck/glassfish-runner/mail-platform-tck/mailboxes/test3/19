** Hello! I am not in this alias.   Please include me in your reply. **

The dtscreen (-mode option) allows an animated image display like pyro 
or qix, but it looks like dtscreen is used with a screenlock feature 
(user locks the screen).


My customer is interested in using the same animated image display 
with a screenblank feature (inactivity auto timeout).  The default
seems to make the screen go blank.

Is this possible to use an animated image instead of going blank
with the screenblank, and any tips on how to do it?

I guess what I am really looking for here is a "ScreenAminated with
a timeout" instead of a screenblank :).


Regards,
