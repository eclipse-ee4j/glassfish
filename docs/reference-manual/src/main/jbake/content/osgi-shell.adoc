Description

The `osgi-shell` subcommand provides interactive access to the Apache
Felix Gogo remote shell for the execution of OSGi shell commands. The
remote shell is provided with \{product---name} and used to administer
and inspect the OSGi runtime.

OSGi shell commands are executed on the server and results are printed
on the client. Because the shell is interactive, no operands are
accepted. Scripting is supported, which means that multiple commands can
be executed in sequence from a text file.

A related subcommand is the `osgi` subcommand, which passes a single
command to the remote shell for execution. Results are returned by the
`asadmin` utility. For more information about the `osgi` subcommand, see
the link:osgi.html#osgi-1[`osgi`(1)] help page.

This subcommand is supported in local mode only. Unlike other local
subcommands, however, the domain administration server (DAS) and the
server instance whose shell is being accessed must be running.
