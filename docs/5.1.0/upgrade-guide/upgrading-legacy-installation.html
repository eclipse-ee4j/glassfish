<h4 id="_upgrade_paths">Upgrade Paths</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two general paths you can use when upgrading to GlassFish
Server 4.0:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Side-by-Side</dt>
<dd>
<p>A side-by-side upgrade means that the new GlassFish Server release is
installed in a different directory than the release from which you are
upgrading.<br>
In this scenario, you perform the following steps:<br></p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Perform a basic installation of GlassFish Server 4.0 in a location
other than the one being used for the older product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Upgrade Tool to migrate the old configurations and
applications to the new GlassFish Server 4.0 directories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test the new GlassFish Server installation to make sure everything
is working properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are satisfied that the new installation works properly,
modify your production environment to use the new installation.<br>
The side-by-side upgrade path is typically used for live production
environments because it allows you to thoroughly test the new
GlassFish Server installation before bringing it into production.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">In-Place</dt>
<dd>
<p>An in-place upgrade means that the new GlassFish Server release is
installed directly over and into the same directory as the previous
product release. The existing configuration is reused in the updated
installation.<br>
In this scenario, you simply use Update Tool, the <code>pkg</code> utility, or
the Update Notifier in your old installation to overwrite the old
installation with the new GlassFish Server 4.0 product.<br>
Performing an in-place upgrade is easier than performing a
side-by-side upgrade, but you lose the ability to switch back and
forth between the old and new installations. There is also no way to
revert an in-place upgrade back to the previous product version.
Because of these limitations, in-place upgrades are typically only
used by developers and for non-production GlassFish Server
deployments.<br>
Note also that it is only possible to perform an in-place upgrade when
upgrading from GlassFish Server 3.1.1, 3.1, 3.0.1, or v3. If you are
upgrading from product versions prior to 3x, you must perform a
side-by-side upgrade.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following are important terms related to the upgrade process.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Source Domain Directory</dt>
<dd>
<p>The directory of the server domain from which you are upgrading to the
new version (for example, <code>c:\glassfish\domains\domain1</code>).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Target Root Domain&#8217;s Directory</dt>
<dd>
<p>The directory where domains are created on the server to which you are
upgrading (for example, <code>c:\glassfish3\glassfish\domains</code>).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Master Password</dt>
<dd>
<p>The SSL certificate database password used in operations such as
GlassFish Server startup. This term refers to the master password of
the installation from which you want to upgrade. You need to specify
this password if you have changed it from the default value of
<code>changeit</code>.</p>

<p>The Upgrade Tool upgrades your domain configurations and deployed
applications. When you use the Upgrade Tool, the source server and the
target server are normally installed on the same machine, but under
different install locations. Both server file systems must be accessible
from the system on which you perform the upgrade.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To perform the upgrade, the user who runs the upgrade needs to have read
permissions for the source and target directories and write permission
for the target directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can perform an upgrade using Upgrade Tool in the following ways:</p>

<p>The Upgrade Tool migrates the configurations and deployed applications
from an earlier version of Sun Java System Application Server or Sun
GlassFishEnterprise Server to the current version. Database migrations
or conversions are not part of this upgrade process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Briefly, the Upgrade Tool performs the following steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Copies the older source domain directory to the new target <code>domains</code>
directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calls the <code>asadmin start-domain --upgrade</code> command to migrate the
source configurations to the new target GlassFish Server installation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sends all <code>asadmin</code> command output to the screen and to the
<code>upgrade.log</code> file, and sends all server output to the <code>server.log</code>
file.</p>

<h5 id="_migration_of_deployed_applications">Migration of Deployed Applications</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Application archives (EAR files) and component archives (JAR, WAR, and
RAR files) that are deployed in the source server do not require any
modification to run on GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 4.0.
Components that may have incompatibilities are deployed on GlassFish
Server 4.0 with the <code>compatibility</code> property set to <code>v2</code> and will run
without change on GlassFish Server 4.0. You may, however, want to
consider modifying the applications to conform to Java EE 6
requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Java EE 6 platform specification imposes stricter requirements than
Java EE 5 did on which JAR files can be visible to various modules
within an EAR file. In particular, application clients must not have
access to EJB JAR files or other JAR files in the EAR file unless they
use a <code>Class-Path</code> header in the manifest file, or unless references use
the standard Java SE mechanisms (extensions, for example), or use the
Java EE <code>library-directory</code> mechanism. Setting the <code>library-directory</code>
property to <code>v2</code> removes these Java EE 6 restrictions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications and components that are deployed in the source server are
deployed on the target server during the upgrade. Applications that do
not deploy successfully on the target server must be deployed manually
on the target server by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a domain contains information about a deployed application and the
installed application components do not agree with the configuration
information, the configuration is migrated unchanged, without any
attempt to reconfigure the incorrect configurations.</p>

<h5 id="_upgrade_of_clusters">Upgrade of Clusters</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When upgrading from a clustered configuration, the older cluster
information is retained in a new <code>domain.xml</code> file in the GlassFish
Server 4.0 installation directories. However, it is still necessary to
manually re-create the server instances that are contained in the
clusters. This procedure is explained in <a href="#gfybw">Upgrading Clusters
and Node Agent Configurations</a>.</p>

<p>An upgrade log records the upgrade activity. The upgrade log file is
named <code>upgrade.log</code> and is created in the working directory from which
the Upgrade Tool is run. Additional information is recorded in the
server log of the upgraded domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also use the <code>asadmin version</code> subcommand after starting the
upgraded domain to verify the new GlassFish Server product version; for
example:</p>

<p>Explanations of these options are provided at the end of this procedure.
4.  Follow the prompts to perform the upgrade.<br>
If a name used for an older domain that you are upgrading already exists
in the new target domains directory, Upgrade Tool will ask if you want
to rename the new directory so the old directory can be copied to the
new installation.
* If you type <code>y</code> in response, the directory is renamed
domain-name`.original`. If that name already exists, the directory will
be renamed domain-name`.orginal.0`. For example, if the old domain
directory is named <code>domain1</code>, it will be renamed <code>domain1.original</code>, or
if that name already exists, <code>domain1.original.0</code>.
* If you type <code>n</code>, you are prompted to specify a different directory
name or quit.<br>
The domain is upgraded and the results are output to the console.
5.  Review the console output to verify that the upgrade proceeded
correctly.<br>
This output is also written to the <code>output.log</code> file for later review.<br>
If there are any <code>SEVERE</code> or <code>WARNING</code> messages in the <code>server.log</code>
file, the upgrade output will say
<code>"Possible error encountered during upgrade. See server log after upgrade process completes."</code>
6.  Start the upgraded GlassFish Server 4.0 domain.<br></p>

<p>This section explains additional steps you need to perform when
upgrading cluster and node agent configurations from Application Server

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GlassFish Server 4.0 does not support node agents. As part of the
upgrade process, any node agent elements in the older source
configuration are transformed into <code>CONFIG</code> node elements in the

configuration is incompatible with your GlassFish Server 4.0
installation, you must correct the node configuration on the upgraded
DAS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, although the source cluster configuration is retained in
the <code>domain.xml</code> file for the upgraded DAS, it is still necessary to
install GlassFish Server 4.0 on each node host and manually re-create
the server instances that are contained in the clusters.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of the upgrade process, node agent elements in the DAS
configuration are transformed into GlassFish Server node elements of
type <code>CONFIG</code>. This transformation does not affect the node agent
directories for GlassFish Server instances. To create the equivalent
directories for GlassFish Server instances after an upgrade, you must
re-create the instances as explained in <a href="#gktkx">To Re-Create a
Cluster</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The name of an upgraded node is the name of the node agent from which
the node is transformed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The host that the node represents is obtained from the configuration of
the original node agent or, if not specified, is not set. If the
configuration of the original node agent did not specify the name of the
node host, you must update the node to specify the host that the node
represents.</p>

<p>Default values are applied to the remainder of the node&#8217;s configuration
data.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The parent of the base installation directory of the GlassFish Server
software on the host, for example, <code>/export/glassfish3</code>.<br>
The default is the parent of the default base installation directory of
the GlassFish Server 4.0 software on the DAS host. If the GlassFish
Server software is installed under a different directory on the node
host, you must update the node&#8217;s configuration to specify the correct
directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The directory that will contain the GlassFish Server instances that
are to reside on the node.<br>
The default is as-install`/nodes`, where as-install is the base
installation directory of the GlassFish Server software on the host. If
you require the instances to be contained in a different directory, you
must update the node&#8217;s configuration to specify that directory.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using secure shell (SSH) for centralized administration, you
must also change the type of the node to <code>SSH</code> to enable the node for
