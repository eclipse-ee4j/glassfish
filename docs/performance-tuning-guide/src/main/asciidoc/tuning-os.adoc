== 5 Tuning the Operating System and Platform

This chapter discusses tuning the operating system (OS) for optimum
performance. It discusses the following topics:

* xref:#server-scaling[Server Scaling]
* xref:#solaris-10-platform-specific-tuning-information[Solaris 10 Platform-Specific Tuning Information]

[[server-scaling]]

=== Server Scaling

This section provides recommendations for optimal performance scaling
server for the following server subsystems:

* xref:#processors[Processors]
* xref:#memory[Memory]
* xref:#disk-space[Disk Space]
* xref:#networking[Networking]
* xref:#udp-buffer-sizes[UDP Buffer Sizes]

[[processors]]

==== Processors

The {productName} automatically takes advantage of multiple CPUs. In
general, the effectiveness of multiple CPUs varies with the operating
system and the workload, but more processors will generally improve
dynamic content performance.

Static content involves mostly input/output (I/O) rather than CPU
activity. If the server is tuned properly, increasing primary memory
will increase its content caching and thus increase the relative amount
of time it spends in I/O versus CPU activity. Studies have shown that
doubling the number of CPUs increases servlet performance by 50 to 80
percent.

[[memory]]

==== Memory

See the section Hardware and Software Requirements in the {productName} Release Notes for specific memory recommendations for each
supported operating system.

[[disk-space]]

==== Disk Space

It is best to have enough disk space for the OS, document tree, and log
files. In most cases 2GB total is sufficient.

Put the OS, swap/paging file, {productName} logs, and document tree
each on separate hard drives. This way, if the log files fill up the log
drive, the OS does not suffer. Also, its easy to tell if the OS paging
file is causing drive activity, for example.

OS vendors generally provide specific recommendations for how much swap
or paging space to allocate. Based on Oracle testing, {productName}
performs best with swap space equal to RAM, plus enough to map the
document tree.

[[networking]]

==== Networking

To determine the bandwidth the application needs, determine the
following values:

* The number of peak concurrent users (N ~peak~) the server needs to
handle.
* The average request size on your site, r. The average request can
include multiple documents. When in doubt, use the home page and all its
associated files and graphics.
* Decide how long, t, the average user will be willing to wait for a
document at peak utilization.

Then, the bandwidth required is:

N~peak~r / t

For example, to support a peak of 50 users with an average document size
of 24 Kbytes, and transferring each document in an average of 5 seconds,
requires 240 Kbytes (1920 Kbit/s). So the site needs two T1 lines (each
1544 Kbit/s). This bandwidth also allows some overhead for growth.

The server's network interface card must support more than the WAN to
which it is connected. For example, if you have up to three T1 lines,
you can get by with a 10BaseT interface. Up to a T3 line (45 Mbit/s),
you can use 100BaseT. But if you have more than 50 Mbit/s of WAN
bandwidth, consider configuring multiple 100BaseT interfaces, or look at
Gigabit Ethernet technology.

[[udp-buffer-sizes]]

==== UDP Buffer Sizes

{productName} uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for the transmission
of multicast messages to {productName} instances in a cluster. For
peak performance from a {productName} cluster that uses UDP
multicast, limit the need to retransmit UDP messages. To limit the need
to retransmit UDP messages, set the size of the UDP buffer to avoid
excessive UDP datagram loss.

[[to-determine-an-optimal-udp-buffer-size]]

===== To Determine an Optimal UDP Buffer Size

The size of UDP buffer that is required to prevent excessive UDP
datagram loss depends on many factors, such as:

* The number of instances in the cluster
* The number of instances on each host
* The number of processors
* The amount of memory
* The speed of the hard disk for virtual memory

If only one instance is running on each host in your cluster, the
default UDP buffer size should suffice. If several instances are running
on each host, determine whether the UDP buffer is large enough by
testing for the loss of UDP packets.


[NOTE]
====
On Linux systems, the default UDP buffer size might be insufficient even
if only one instance is running on each host. In this situation, set the
UDP buffer size as explained in xref:#to-set-the-udp-buffer-size-on-linux-systems[To Set the UDP Buffer Size
on Linux Systems].
====


[[glgiw]]

1. Ensure that no {productName} clusters are running.
+
If necessary, stop any running clusters as explained in
"xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#to-stop-a-cluster[To Stop a Cluster]"
in {productName} High Availability Administration Guide.

2. Determine the absolute number of lost UDP packets when no clusters
are running.
+
How you determine the number of lost packets depends on the operating
system. For example:

* On Linux systems, use the `netstat -su` command and look for the
`packet receive errors` count in the `Udp` section.
* On AIX systems, use the `netstat -s` command and look for the
`fragments dropped (dup or out of space)` count in the `ip` section.

3. Start all the clusters that are configured for your installation of
{productName}.
+
Start each cluster as explained in "xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#to-start-a-cluster[To Start a
Cluster]" in {productName} High Availability
Administration Guide.

4. Determine the absolute number of lost UDP packets after the clusters are started.

5. If the difference in the number of lost packets is significant,
increase the size of the UDP buffer.

[[to-set-the-udp-buffer-size-on-linux-systems]]

===== To Set the UDP Buffer Size on Linux Systems

On Linux systems, a default UDP buffer size is set for the client, but
not for the server. Therefore, on Linux systems, the UDP buffer size
might have to be increased. Setting the UDP buffer size involves setting
the following kernel parameters:

* `net.core.rmem_max`
* `net.core.wmem_max`
* `net.core.rmem_default`
* `net.core.wmem_default`

Set the kernel parameters in the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file or at runtime.

If you set the parameters in the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file, the settings
are preserved when the system is rebooted. If you set the parameters at
runtime, the settings are not preserved when the system is rebooted.

* To set the parameters in the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file, add or edit the
following lines in the file:
+
[source]
----
net.core.rmem_max=rmem-max
net.core.wmem_max=wmem-max
net.core.rmem_default=rmem-default
net.core.wmem_default=wmem-default
----
* To set the parameters at runtime, use the sysctl command.
+
[source]
----
$ /sbin/sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=rmem-max \
net.core.wmem_max=wmem-max \
net.core.rmem_default=rmem-default \
net.core.wmem_default=wmem-default
----

[[tun-ex-5-1]]

=== Solaris 10 Platform-Specific Tuning Information

Solaris Dynamic Tracing (DTrace) is a comprehensive dynamic tracing
framework for the Solaris Operating System (OS). You can use the DTrace
Toolkit to monitor the system. The DTrace Toolkit is available through
the OpenSolaris project from the
http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Community+Group+dtrace/dtracetoolkit[DTraceToolkit
page]
(`http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Community+Group+dtrace/dtracetoolkit`).

[[tuning-parameters]]

==== Tuning Parameters

Tuning Solaris TCP/IP settings benefits programs that open and close
many sockets. Since the {productName} operates with a small fixed set
of connections, the performance gain might not be significant.

The following table shows Solaris tuning parameters that affect
performance and scalability benchmarking. These values are examples of
how to tune your system for best performance.

|===


[[sizing-the-connection-hash-table]]

===== Sizing the Connection Hash Table

The connection hash table keeps all the information for active TCP
connections. Use the following command to get the size of the connection
hash table:

[source]
----
ndd -get /dev/tcp tcp_conn_hash
----

This value does not limit the number of connections, but it can cause
connection hashing to take longer. The default size is 512.

To make lookups more efficient, set the value to half of the number of
concurrent TCP connections that are expected on the server. You can set
this value only in `/etc/system`, and it becomes effective at boot time.

Use the following command to get the current number of TCP connections.

[source]
----
netstat -nP tcp|wc -l
----

[[file-descriptor-setting]]

==== File Descriptor Setting

On the Solaris OS, setting the maximum number of open files property
using `ulimit` has the biggest impact on efforts to support the maximum
number of RMI/IIOP clients.

To increase the hard limit, add the following command to `/etc/system`
and reboot it once:

[source]
----
set rlim_fd_max = 8192
----

Verify this hard limit by using the following command:

[source]
----
ulimit -a -H
----

Once the above hard limit is set, increase the value of this property
explicitly (up to this limit) using the following command:

[source]
----
ulimit -n 8192
----

Verify this limit by using the following command:

[source]
----
ulimit -a
----

For example, with the default `ulimit` of 64, a simple test driver can
support only 25 concurrent clients, but with `ulimit` set to 8192, the
same test driver can support 120 concurrent clients. The test driver
spawned multiple threads, each of which performed a JNDI lookup and
repeatedly called the same business method with a think (delay) time of
500 ms between business method calls, exchanging data of about 100 KB.
These settings apply to RMI/IIOP clients on the Solaris OS.

[[tuning-for-solaris-on-x86]]

=== Tuning for Solaris on x86

The following are some options to consider when tuning Solaris on x86
for {productName}:

* xref:#file-descriptors[File Descriptors]
* xref:#ip-stack-settings[IP Stack Settings]

Some of the values depend on the system resources available. After
making any changes to `/etc/system`, reboot the machines.

[[file-descriptors]]

==== File Descriptors

Add (or edit) the following lines in the `/etc/system` file:

[source]
----
set rlim_fd_max=65536
set rlim_fd_cur=65536
set sq_max_size=0
set tcp:tcp_conn_hash_size=8192
set autoup=60
set pcisch:pci_stream_buf_enable=0
----

These settings affect the file descriptors.

[[ip-stack-settings]]

==== IP Stack Settings

Add (or edit) the following lines in the `/etc/system` file:

[source]
----
set ip:tcp_squeue_wput=1
set ip:tcp_squeue_close=1
set ip:ip_squeue_bind=1
set ip:ip_squeue_worker_wait=10
set ip:ip_squeue_profile=0
----

These settings tune the IP stack.

To preserve the changes to the file between system reboots, place the
following changes to the default TCP variables in a startup script that
gets executed when the system reboots:

[source]
----
ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_time_wait_interval 60000
ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_conn_req_max_q 16384
ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_conn_req_max_q0 16384
ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_ip_abort_interval 60000
ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_keepalive_interval 7200000
ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_rexmit_interval_initial 4000
ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_rexmit_interval_min 3000
ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_rexmit_interval_max 10000
ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_smallest_anon_port 32768
ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_slow_start_initial 2
ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_xmit_hiwat 32768
ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_recv_hiwat 32768
----

[[tuning-for-linux-platforms]]

=== Tuning for Linux platforms

To tune for maximum performance on Linux, you need to make adjustments
to the following:

* xref:#startup-files[Startup Files]
* xref:#file-descriptors-1[File Descriptors]
* xref:#virtual-memory[Virtual Memory]
* xref:#network-interface[Network Interface]
* xref:#disk-io-settings[Disk I/O Settings]
* xref:#tcpip-settings[TCP/IP Settings]

[[startup-files]]

==== Startup Files

The following parameters must be added to the `/etc/rc.d/rc.local` file
that gets executed during system startup.

[source]
----
<-- begin
#max file count updated ~256 descriptors per 4Mb.
Specify number of file descriptors based on the amount of system RAM.

-- end -->
----

Additionally, create an `/etc/sysctl.conf` file and append it with the
following values:

[source]
----
<-- begin
#Disables packet forwarding
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
#Enables source route verification
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
#Disables the magic-sysrq key
kernel.sysrq = 0
fs.file-max=65536
vm.bdflush = 100 1200 128 512 15 5000 500 1884 2
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65000
net.core.rmem_max= 262143
net.core.rmem_default = 262143
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 262143
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 131072 262143
net.ipv4.tcp_sack = 0
net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0
kernel.shmmax = 67108864
----

[[file-descriptors-1]]

==== File Descriptors

You may need to increase the number of file descriptors from the
default. Having a higher number of file descriptors ensures that the
server can open sockets under high load and not abort requests coming in
from clients.

Start by checking system limits for file descriptors with this command:

[source]
----
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
8192
----

The current limit shown is 8192. To increase it to 65535, use the
following command (as root):

[source]
----
echo "65535"> /proc/sys/fs/file-max
----

To make this value to survive a system reboot, add it to
`/etc/sysctl.conf` and specify the maximum number of open files
permitted:

[source]
----
fs.file-max = 65535
----

Note that the parameter is not `proc.sys.fs.file-max`, as one might
expect.

To list the available parameters that can be modified using `sysctl`:

[source]
----
sysctl -a
----

To load new values from the `sysctl.conf` file:

[source]
----
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
----

To check and modify limits per shell, use the following command:

[source]
----
limit
----

The output will look something like this:

[source]
----
cputime         unlimited
filesize        unlimited
datasize        unlimited
stacksize       8192 kbytes
coredumpsize    0 kbytes
memoryuse       unlimited
descriptors     1024
memorylocked    unlimited
maxproc         8146
openfiles       1024
----

The `openfiles` and `descriptors` show a limit of 1024. To increase the
limit to 65535 for all users, edit `/etc/security/limits.conf` as root,
and modify or add the `nofile` setting (number of file) entries:

[source]
----
*         soft    nofile                     65535
*         hard    nofile                     65535
----

The character "`*`" is a wildcard that identifies all users. You could
also specify a user ID instead.

Then edit `/etc/pam.d/login` and add the line:

[source]
----
session required /lib/security/pam_limits.so
----

On Red Hat, you also need to edit `/etc/pam.d/sshd` and add the
following line:

[source]
----
session required /lib/security/pam_limits.so
----

On many systems, this procedure will be sufficient. Log in as a regular
user and try it before doing the remaining steps. The remaining steps
might not be required, depending on how pluggable authentication modules
(PAM) and secure shell (SSH) are configured.

[[virtual-memory]]

==== Virtual Memory

To change virtual memory settings, add the following to `/etc/rc.local`:

[source]
----
echo 100 1200 128 512 15 5000 500 1884 2> /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
----

For more information, view the man pages for `bdflush`.

[[network-interface]]

==== Network Interface

To ensure that the network interface is operating in full duplex mode,
add the following entry into `/etc/rc.local`:

[source]
----
mii-tool -F 100baseTx-FD eth0
----

where eth0 is the name of the network interface card (NIC).

[[disk-io-settings]]

==== Disk I/O Settings

 

[[to-tune-disk-io-performance-for-non-scsi-disks]]

===== To tune disk I/O performance for non SCSI disks

1. Test the disk speed.
+
Use this command:

|Controls streams driver queue size;
setting to 0 makes it infinite so the performance runs won't be hit by
lack of buffer space. Set on clients too. Note that setting
`sq_max_size` to 0 might not be optimal for production systems with high
network traffic.

[[disk-configuration]]

==== Disk Configuration

If HTTP access is logged, follow these guidelines for the disk:

* Write access logs on faster disks or attached storage.
* If running multiple instances, move the logs for each instance onto
separate disks as much as possible.
* Enable the disk read/write cache. Note that if you enable write cache
on the disk, some writes might be lost if the disk fails.
* Consider mounting the disks with the following options, which might
yield better disk performance: `nologging`, `directio`, `noatime`.

[[network-configuration]]

==== Network Configuration

If more than one network interface card is used, make sure the network
interrupts are not all going to the same core. Run the following script
to disable interrupts:

[source]
----
allpsr=`/usr/sbin/psrinfo | grep -v off-line | awk '{ print $1 }'`
   set $allpsr
   numpsr=$#
   while [ $numpsr -gt 0 ];
   do
       shift
       numpsr=`expr $numpsr - 1`
       tmp=1
       while [ $tmp -ne 4 ];
       do
           /usr/sbin/psradm -i $1
           shift
           numpsr=`expr $numpsr - 1`
           tmp=`expr $tmp + 1`
       done
   done
----

Put all network interfaces into a single group. For example:

[source]
----
$ifconfig ipge0 group webserver
$ifconfig ipge1 group webserver
