# Releasing a new GlassFish version

In this example we assume 7.0.19.

1. Check beforehand that this version does NOT exist in [staging](https://jakarta.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/staging/org/glassfish/main/distributions/glassfish/) else bump the version
2. Go to [GlassFish CI](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/)
3. [Log in](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/login?from=%2Fglassfish%2F)
4. Open [glassfish_1-build-and-stage](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/view/GlassFish/job/glassfish_1-build-and-stage/)
5. Click [Build with parameters](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/view/GlassFish/job/glassfish_1-build-and-stage//build) in menu 
    - `RELEASE_VERSION` = `7.0.19`
    - `USE_STAGING_REPO` = `false` (uncheck)
    - click [Build] button
6. Wait for it to finish successfully
7. Drill down into this build e.g. [build 79](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/view/GlassFish/job/glassfish_1-build-and-stage/79/)
8. Click [Console Output](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/view/GlassFish/job/glassfish_1-build-and-stage/79/console) in menu
9. Ctrl+F 'orgglassfish', to find release ID, e.g. `Created staging repository with ID "orgglassfish-1230"`, remember this for `STAGING_RELEASE_ID` in a later step
   In case the release ID is not in the log (sometimes it just isn't, we don't know why), use
   go to [jsftemplating_1_build-and-stage]()https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/view/JSFTemplating/job/jsftemplating_1_build-and-stage/build
    - `LIST_FIRST` = `true` (check)
    - click [Build] button
   In the output, look for a line like the following:
   ```
   [INFO] orgglassfish-1352    CLOSED   org.glassfish.main:glassfish-main-aggregator:7.0.19
   ```
10. Verify that 7.0.19 is present in [staging](https://jakarta.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/staging/org/glassfish/main/distributions/glassfish/)
11. Verify that a new [7.0.19](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/tree/7.0.19-BRANCH) branch is created 
12. Run the TCKs against the staged build at https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/view/EFTL-Certification-Jobs-10/
13. Run the [platform TCK](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/view/EFTL-Certification-Jobs-10/job/10/job/eftl-jakartaeetck-run-100/)
14. Run the [standalone TCK](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-tck/view/EFTL-Certification-Jobs-10/job/eftl-jakartaeetck-run-standalone/)
15. Wait for it to finish successfully
16. Open [3_staging-to-release](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/job/3_glassfish-staging-to-release/)
17. Click [Build with parameters](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/job/3_glassfish-staging-to-release/build) in menu
    - `STAGING_RELEASE_ID` = `orgglassfish-1352`
    - click [Build] button
18. Wait for it to finish successfully
19. Verify that it's present in [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/glassfish/main/distributions/glassfish/) (usually takes few minutes now)
20. If everything is OK, then merge 7.0.19 branch into master via PR
21. Delete the 7.0.19 branch after merge
22. Upload the new release to the Eclipse download folder. 
    Go to [glassfish_copy-staging-to-downloads](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/job/glassfish-website-publish-zips-from-staging/)
    - Enter the version to copy; 7.0.19
    - click [Build] button 
23. Create the release on Github: https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/releases click "draft a new release"
24. Create the release on Eclipse: https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.glassfish click "create a new release"
25. Create the release on Glassfish.org. Do a PR for the **master** branch with:
