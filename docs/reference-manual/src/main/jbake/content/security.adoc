Description

Security is about protecting data: how to prevent unauthorized access or
damage to it in storage or transit. \{product---name} has a dynamic,
extensible security architecture based on the Java EE standard. Built in
security features include cryptography, authentication and
authorization, and public key infrastructure. \{product---name} is built
on the Java security model, which uses a sandbox where applications can
run safely, without potential risk to systems or users.
