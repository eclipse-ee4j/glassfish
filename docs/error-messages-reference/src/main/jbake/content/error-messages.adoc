1 GlassFish Server Open Source Edition Error Messages
-----------------------------------------------------

This chapter provides a compilation of error messages that you might
encounter when using GlassFish Server Open Source Edition.

Error messages provide information about events that occur during
GlassFish Server operation, such as configuration errors, security
failures, or server malfunction. These messages often include diagnostic
and troubleshooting information.

Error messages can also be viewed in the Administration Console Log
Viewer. For more information about logging, see
”link:../administration-guide/logging.html#GSADG00010[Administering the Logging Service”] in GlassFish
Server Open Source Edition Administration Guide.

For additional troubleshooting information, see the
link:../troubleshooting-guide/toc.html#GSTSG[GlassFish Server Open Source Edition Troubleshooting Guide].

Error messages in this chapter are listed in alphabetic and numeric
order by message ID. The text is as it appears in the actual error
message.

[[sthref3]]AS-ACDEPL-00103 Java Web Start services started for the app client \{0} (contextRoot: \{1}) ::
  Cause: As described in the message. +
  Action: Resolve the situation described in the message, if necessary.

[[sthref5]]AS-ACDEPL-00108 Config file for client JNLP not found: \{0} ::
  Cause: The config file does not exist. +
  Action: The file is part of the installation so this might be an
  internal error. Make sure you have not accidentally removed or renamed
  the config file. If not, please file an error with a reproducible test
  case.

[[sthref6]]AS-ACDEPL-00109 The config file for client JNLP \{0} exists but could not be read. ::
  Cause: The config file might be protected from reading. +
  Action: Make sure the config file protection settings permit the
  server to read it.

[[sthref7]]AS-ACDEPL-00111 Client JNLP document \{0} refers to the static resource \{1} that does not exist or is not readable. ::
  Cause: The developer-provided JNLP content refers to a file as if the
  file is in the application but the server could not find the file. +
  Action: Make sure the file is packaged in the application and that the
  reference to the file is correct. Then rebuild and redeploy the
  application.

[[sthref8]]AS-ACDEPL-00112 The following extensions or libraries are referenced from the manifest of \{0} but were not found where indicated: \{1}; ignoring and continuing ::
  Cause: The server could not open the JAR file(s) or process the

[[sthref10]]AS-ACDEPL-00115 Tbe custom JNLP document \{0} in a stand-alone app client incorrectly refers to a JAR \{1} ::
  Cause: The app client includes a custom JNLP document which refers to
  a JAR. Stand-alone app clients cannot refer to other JARs because they
  are self-contained deployment units. +
  Action: Remove references to JAR from the custom JNLP document or
  package the app client inside an EAR that also contains the referenced
  JAR.

[[sthref11]]AS_ACDEPL-00101 Java Web Start services not started for the app client \{0}; its developer has marked it as ineligible ::
  Cause: The developer's glassfish-application-client.xml file marks the

  Start, change the <java-web-start-support> 'enabled' attribute.

[[sthref12]]AS_ACDEPL-00104 Java Web Start services stopped for the app client \{0} ::
  Cause: As described in the message. +
  Action: Resolve the situation described in the message, if necessary.

[[sthref13]]AS_ACDEPL_00102 Java Web Start services not started for the app client \{0}; the administrator has disabled Java Web Start support for it ::
  Cause: The administrator disabled Java Web Start launches for the app
  client, either using '--properties java-web-start-enabled=false'
  during deployment or changing the properties afterwards. +

  Start, either deploy the application again without --properties or
  adjust the configuration using the admin console or the asadmin 'set'
  command
