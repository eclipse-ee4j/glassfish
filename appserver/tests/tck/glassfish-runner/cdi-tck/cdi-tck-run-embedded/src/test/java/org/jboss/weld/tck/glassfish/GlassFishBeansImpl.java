/**
 * CDI TCK tests use this class as an adapter between the test application and server container.
 * Then it's implementation can simplify the behavior, ie. explicit passivation, while
 * in a real application the decision to passivate/activate some object is on the container
 * and cannot be requested by the application.
 * <p>
 * Until GlassFish provides standalone utility to do that, we have to fake
 * the passivation/activation.
