<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before installing Eclipse GlassFish Server 5.1, ensure that
your system meets the requirements listed in "<a href="../release-notes/release-notes.html#GSRLN00131">Hardware
and Software Requirements</a>" in Eclipse GlassFish Server
Release Notes. If necessary, download and install the required JDK
software. Problems are likely to arise if you attempt to install on a
platform that is not supported or on a system that in some other way
does not meet release requirements. Also see "<a href="../release-notes/release-notes.html#GSRLN00253">Known
Issues</a>" in Eclipse GlassFish Server Release Notes for known
issues related to installation.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>On Solaris, Linux, and Windows systems, JDK software is available from
the
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java
SE downloads page</a>
(<code>http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Mac OS X systems, GlassFish Server uses the JDK that is part of
the Macintosh operating system. If necessary, obtain the required JDK

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3.1. Application of License.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed
only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License
released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License
with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
However, You may include an additional document offering the additional
rights described in Section 3.5.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has
been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3.3. Description of Modifications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
ownership of the Covered Code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>\(a) Third Party Claims.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#8217;s
intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include
a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which
describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
(such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
knowledge has been obtained.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>\(b) Contributor APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If Contributor&#8217;s Modifications include an application programming
interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
include this information in the LEGAL file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>\(c) Representations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#8217;s Modifications are
Contributor&#8217;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3.5. Required Notices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to
look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You
may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.
You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source
Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating
to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
offer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and
if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in
an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights
under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
to limit or alter the recipient&#8217;s rights in the Source Code version from
the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not
by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
such terms You offer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3.7. Larger Works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>\4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included
in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>\5. Application of this License.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.</p>

<p>6.3. Derivative Works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
phrases <em>'Mozilla</em>', <em>'MOZILLAPL</em>', <em>'MOZPL</em>', <em>'Netscape</em>', "MPL",
<em>'NPL</em>' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license
(except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b)
otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms
which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public
License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or
Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves
be deemed to be modifications of this License.)</p>
