Description

The `unset` subcommand removes one or more environment variables that
are set for the multimode environment. After removal, the variables and
their associated values no longer apply to the multimode environment.

To list the environment variables that are set, use the `export`
subcommand without options. If the `export` subcommand lists no
environment variables, no environment variables are set.

This subcommand is supported in local mode only.
