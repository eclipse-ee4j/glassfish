Configures the starting of a DAS or a {productName} instance on an

=== Description

The `create-service` subcommand configures the starting of a domain
administration server (DAS) or a {productName} instance on an
unattended boot on Windows and Linux systems.

If no operand is specified and the domains directory contains only one
domain, the subcommand configures the starting of the DAS for the
default domain. If no operand is specified and the domains directory
contains multiple domains, an error occurs.

If the operand specifies an instance, the `create-service` subcommand
does not contact the domain administration server (DAS) to determine the
node on which the instance resides. To determine the node on which the
instance resides, the subcommand searches the directory that contains
the node directories. If multiple node directories exist, the node must
be specified as an option of the subcommand.

The subcommand contains internal logic to determine whether the supplied
operand is a DAS or an instance.

This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

==== Behavior of `create-service` on Windows Systems

On Windows systems, the `create-service` subcommand creates a Windows
service to represent the DAS or instance. The service is created in the
**automatic** state. After this subcommand creates the service, you must
use the Windows Services Manager or the Windows Services Wrapper to start,
stop, uninstall, or install the service.

On Windows systems, this subcommand must be run as the OS-level
administrator user.

The subcommand creates the following Windows Services Wrapper files for
the service in the domain-dir``\bin`` directory or the instance-dir``\bin``
directory:

* Configuration file: service-name``Service.xml``
* Executable file: service-name``Service.exe``

On Windows systems, this subcommand requires the
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/[Microsoft .NET Framework] 4.6.1 or later
(https://dotnet.microsoft.com/). Otherwise, the subcommand fails.

==== Behavior of `create-service` on Linux Systems

On Linux systems, the `create-service` subcommand creates a
System-V-style initialization script
`/etc/init.d/GlassFish_`domain-or-instance-name and installs a link to
this script in the `/etc/rc?.d` directories. After this subcommand
creates the script, you must use this script to start, stop, or restart
the domain or instance.

On Linux systems, this subcommand must be run as the OS-level root user.

=== Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these
  options, see the xref:asadmin.adoc#asadmin[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--name`::
  (Windows systems only) The name of the service that
  you will use when administering the service through  the service
  management features of the Windows operating system.
  The default is the name of the domain or instance that is
  specified as the operand of this subcommand.
`--serviceproperties`::
  Specifies a colon(:)-separated list of various properties that are
  specific to the service. +
  To customize the display name of the service in the Windows Service
  list, set the `DISPLAY_NAME` property to the required name.
`--dry-run`::
`-n`::
  Previews your attempt to create a service. Indicates issues and the
  outcome that will occur if you run the command without using the
  `--dry-run` option. Nothing is actually configured. Default is false.
`--force`::
  Specifies whether the service is created even if validation of the
  service fails. +
  Possible values are as follows:

  `true`;;
    The service is created even if validation of the service fails.
  `false`;;
    The service is not created (default).

`--serviceuser`::
  (Linux systems only) The user that is to run the {productName}
  software when the service is started. The default is the user that is
  running the subcommand. Specify this option if the {productName}
  software is to be run by a user other than the root user.
`--domaindir`::
  The absolute path of the directory on the disk that contains the
  configuration of the domain. If this option is specified, the operand
  must specify a domain.
`--nodedir`::
  Specifies the directory that contains the instance's node directory.
  The instance's files are stored in the instance's node directory. The
  default is as-install``/nodes``. If this option is specified, the
  operand must specify an instance.
`--node`::
  Specifies the node on which the instance resides. This option may be
  omitted only if the directory that the `--nodedir` option specifies
  contains only one node directory. Otherwise, this option is required.
  If this option is specified, the operand must specify an instance.

=== Operands

domain-or-instance-name::
  The name of the domain or instance to configure. If no operand is
  specified, the default domain is used.

==== Example 1   Creating a Service on a Windows System

This example creates a service for the default domain on a system that
is running Windows.

[source]
----
asadmin> create-service
The Windows Service was created successfully.  It is ready to be started.  Here are
the details:
ID of the service: domain1
Display Name of the service:domain1 Eclipse GlassFish
Server Directory: C:\glassfish7\glassfish\domains\domain1
Configuration file for Windows Services Wrapper: C:\glassfish7\glassfish\domains\
domain1\bin\domain1Service.xml
The service can be controlled using the Windows Services Manager or you can use the
Windows Services Wrapper instead:
Start Command:  C:\glassfish7\glassfish\domains\domain1\bin\domain1Service.exe  start
Stop Command:   C:\glassfish7\glassfish\domains\domain1\bin\domain1Service.exe  stop
Restart Command:  C:\glassfish7\glassfish\domains\domain1\bin\domain1Service.exe
restart
Uninstall Command:  C:\glassfish7\glassfish\domains\domain1\bin\domain1Service.exe
uninstall
Install Command:  C:\glassfish7\glassfish\domains\domain1\bin\domain1Service.exe
install
Status Command: C:\glassfish7\glassfish\domains\domain1\bin\domain1Service.exe status
You can also verify that the service is installed (or not) with sc query state= all
windows.services.uninstall.good=Found the Windows Service and successfully uninstall
it.
For your convenience this message has also been saved to this file:
C:\glassfish7\glassfish\domains\domain1\PlatformServices.log
Command create-service executed successfully.

==== Example 2   Creating a Service on a Linux System

This example creates a service for the default domain on a system that
is running Linux.

[source]
----
asadmin> create-service
Found the Linux Service and successfully uninstalled it.
The Service was created successfully. Here are the details:
Name of the service:domain1
Type of the service:Domain
Configuration location of the service:/etc/init.d/GlassFish_domain1
User account that will run the service: root
You have created the service but you need to start it yourself.
Here are the most typical Linux commands of interest:

* /etc/init.d/GlassFish_domain1 start
* /etc/init.d/GlassFish_domain1 stop
* /etc/init.d/GlassFish_domain1 restart

For your convenience this message has also been saved to this file:
/export/glassfish7/glassfish/domains/domain1/PlatformServices.log
Command create-service executed successfully.
----

=== Exit Status

0::
  subcommand executed successfully
1::
  error in executing the subcommand
