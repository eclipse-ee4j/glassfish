== rotate-log

Rotates the log file

=== Synopsis

[source]
----
asadmin [asadmin-options] rotate-log [--help]
----

=== Description

The `rotate-log` subcommand rotates the server log by renaming the file
with a timestamp name in the format `server.log_`date-and-time, and
creating a new log file. Changes take effect dynamically, that is,
server restart is not required.

The size of the log queue is configurable through the
`logging.properties` file. Log rotation is based on file size or elapsed
time since the last log rotation. In some circumstances, the queue might
fill up, especially if the log level is set to `FINEST` and there is
heavy activity on the server. In this case, the `rotate-log` subcommand
can be used to rotate the server log immediately. This subcommand is
also useful in creating scripts for rotating the log at convenient times.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

=== Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these
  options, see the xref:asadmin.adoc#asadmin[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--target`::
  The server, cluster, or server instance for which logs will be
  rotated. If this option is omitted, logs are rotated for the default
  server.

=== Operands

target::
  Valid values are:

  * server_name - Default target is `server`. If no target is specified
    then logs are rotated for the server.
  * cluster_name - The name of a target cluster.
  * instance_name - The name of a target server instance.
