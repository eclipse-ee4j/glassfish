Description

The `jms-ping` subcommand checks if the Java Message Service (JMS)
service (also known as the JMS provider) is up and running. When you
start the \{product---name}, the JMS service starts by default.

The `jms-ping` subcommand pings only the default JMS host within the JMS
service. It displays an error message when it is unable to ping a
built-in JMS service.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only. Remote `asadmin`
subcommands require a running domain administration server (DAS).
