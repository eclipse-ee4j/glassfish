== ping-node-dcom

Tests if a node that is enabled for communication over DCOM is usable

=== Synopsis

[source]
----
asadmin [asadmin-options] ping-node-dcom [--help]
[--validate={false|true}] node-name
----

=== Description

The `ping-node-dcom` subcommand tests if a node that is enabled for
communication over the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) remote
protocol is usable. The DCOM protocol is available only on Windows
systems. This subcommand requires DCOM to be configured on the machine
where the domain administration server (DAS) is running and on the
machine where the node resides. You may run this command from any
machine that can contact the DAS.

If the node is usable, the subcommand displays a confirmation that the
subcommand could connect to the node through DCOM. This confirmation
includes the name of the host that the node represents.

Optionally, the subcommand can also validate the node to determine if
the xref:asadmin.adoc#asadmin[`asadmin`(1M)] utility can run on the
host that the node represents. To validate a node, the subcommand runs
the xref:version.adoc#version[`version`(1)] subcommand. If the node is
valid, the subcommand displays the version that the `version` subcommand
returns.

The node that is specified as the operand of this subcommand must be
enabled for communication over DCOM. If the node is not enabled for
communication over DCOM, an error occurs. To determine whether a node is
enabled for communication over DCOM, use the
xref:list-nodes.adoc#list-nodes[`list-nodes`(1)] subcommand.


[NOTE]
====
To test whether a node that is enabled for communication over secure
shell (SSH) is usable, use the
xref:ping-node-ssh.adoc#ping-node-ssh[`ping-node-ssh`(1)] subcommand.
====


This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
