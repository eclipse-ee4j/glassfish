5 Adding Monitoring Capabilities
--------------------------------

Monitoring is the process of reviewing the statistics of a system to
improve performance or solve problems. By monitoring the state of
components and services that are deployed in the GlassFish Server,
system administrators can identify performance bottlenecks, predict
failures, perform root cause analysis, and ensure that everything is
functioning as expected. Monitoring data can also be useful in
performance tuning and capacity planning.

An add-on component typically generates statistics that the GlassFish
Server can gather at run time. Adding monitoring capabilities enables an
add-on component to provide statistics to GlassFish Server in the same
way as components that are supplied in GlassFish Server distributions.
As a result, system administrators can use the same administrative
interfaces to monitor statistics from any installed GlassFish Server
component, regardless of the origin of the component.

The following topics are addressed here:

* link:#ghopc[Defining Statistics That Are to Be Monitored]
* link:#ghplw[Updating the Monitorable Object Tree]
* link:#ghrma[Dotted Names and REST URLs for an Add-On Component's
Statistics]
* link:#ghptj[Example of Adding Monitoring Capabilities]

[[ghopc]][[GSACG00116]][[defining-statistics-that-are-to-be-monitored]]

Defining Statistics That Are to Be Monitored
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At runtime, your add-on component might perform operations that affect
the behavior and performance of your system. For example, your component
might start a thread of control, receive a request from a service, or
request a connection from a connection pool. Monitoring the statistics
that are related to these operations helps a system administrator
maintain the system.

To provide statistics to GlassFish Server, your component must define
events for the operations that generate these statistics. At runtime,
your component must send these events when performing the operations for
which the events are defined. For example, to enable the number of
received requests to be monitored, a component must send a "request
received" event each time that the component receives a request.

A statistic can correspond to single event or to multiple events.

* Counter statistics typically correspond to a single event. For
example, to calculate the number of received requests, only one event is
required, for example, a "request received" event. Every time that a
"request received" event is sent, the number of received requests is
increased by 1.
* Timer statistics typically correspond to multiple events. For example,
to calculate the time to process a request, two requests, for example, a
"request received" event and a "request completed" event.

Defining statistics that are to be monitored involves the following
tasks:

* link:#gkadk[Defining an Event Provider]
* link:#ghprg[Sending an Event]

[[gkadk]][[GSACG00220]][[defining-an-event-provider]]

Defining an Event Provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An event provider defines the types of events for the operations that
generate statistics for an add-on component.

GlassFish Server enables you to define an event provider in the
following ways:

* By writing a Java Class. Define an event provider this way if you have
access to the source code of the component for which you are defining an
event provider.
* By writing an XML fragment. Define an event provider this way if you
do not have access to the source code of the component for which you are
defining and event provider.

[[ghovq]][[GSACG00164]][[defining-an-event-provider-by-writing-a-java-class]]

Defining an Event Provider by Writing a Java Class
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To define an event provider, write a Java language class that defines
the types of events for the component. Your class is not required to
extend any specific class or implement any interfaces.

To identify your class as an event provider, annotate the declaration of
the class with the
`org.glassfish.external.probe.provider.annotations.ProbeProvider`
annotation.

To create a name space for event providers and to uniquely identify an
event provider to the monitoring infrastructure of GlassFish Server, set
the elements of the `@ProbeProvider` annotation as follows:

`moduleProviderName`::
  Your choice of text to identify the application to which the event
  provider belongs. The value of the `moduleProviderName` element is not
  required to be unique. +
  For example, for event providers from GlassFish Server Open Source
  Edition, `moduleProviderName` is `glassfish`.
`moduleName`::
  Your choice of name for the module for which the event provider is
  defined. A module provides significant functionality of an
  application. The value of the `moduleName` element is not required to
  be unique. +
  In GlassFish Server, examples of module names are `web-container`,
  `ejb-container`, `transaction`, and `webservices`.
`probeProviderName`::
  Your choice of name to identify the event provider. To uniquely
  identify the event provider, ensure that `probeProviderName` is unique
  for all event providers in the same module. +
  In GlassFish Server, examples of eventâ€”provider names are `jsp`,
  `servlet`, and `web-module`.

[[ghosi]][[GSACG00011]][[defining-event-types-in-an-event-provider-class]]

Defining Event Types in an Event Provider Class

To define event types in an event provider class, write one method for
each type of event that is related to the component. The requirements
for each method are as follows:

* The return value of the callback methods must be void.
* The method body must be empty. You instantiate the event provider
class in the class that invokes the method to send the event. For more
information, see link:#ghprg[Sending an Event].
* To enable the event to be used as an Oracle Solaris DTrace probe, each
parameter in the method signature must be a Java language primitive,
such as `Integer`, `boolean`, or `String`.

Annotate the declaration of each method with the
`org.glassfish.external.probe.provider.annotations.Probe` annotation.

By default, the type of the event is the method name. If you overload a
method in your class, you must uniquely identify the event type for each
form of the method. To uniquely identify the event type, set the `name`
element of the `@Probe` annotation to the name of the event type.

Note:

You are not required to uniquely identify the event type for methods
that are not overloaded.

[[ghoul]][[GSACG00012]][[specifying-event-parameters]]

Specifying Event Parameters

To enable methods in an event listener to select a subset of values,
annotate each parameter in the method signature with the
`org.glassfish.external.probe.provider.annotations.ProbeParam`
annotation. Set the `value` element of the `@ProbeParam` annotation to
the name of the parameter.

Defining an Event Provider by Writing an XML Fragment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To define an event provider, write an extensible markup language (XML)
fragment that contains a single `probe-provider` element.

To create a name space for event providers and to uniquely identify an
event provider to the monitoring infrastructure of GlassFish Server, set
the attributes of the `probe-provider` element as follows:

`moduleProviderName`::
  Your choice of text to identify the application to which the event
  provider belongs. The value of the `moduleProviderName` attribute is
  not required to be unique. +
  For example, for event providers from GlassFish Server Open Source
  Edition, `moduleProviderName` is `glassfish`.
`moduleName`::
  Your choice of name for the module for which the event provider is
  defined. A module provides significant functionality of an
  application. The value of the `moduleName` attribute is not required
  to be unique. +
  In GlassFish Server, examples of module names are `web-container`,
  `ejb-container`, `transaction`, and `webservices`.
`probeProviderName`::
  Your choice of name to identify the event provider. To uniquely
  identify the event provider, ensure that `probeProviderName` is unique
  for all event providers in the same module. +
  In GlassFish Server, examples of eventâ€”provider names are `jsp`,
  `servlet`, and `web-module`.

Within the `probe-provider` element, add one `probe` element for each
event type that you are defining. To identify the event type, set the
name attribute of the `probe` element to the type.

To define the characteristics of each event type, add the following
elements within the `probe` element:

`class`::
  This element contains the fully qualified Java class name of the
  component that generates the statistics for which you are defining
  events.
`method`::
  This element contains the name of the method that is invoked to
  generate the statistic.
`signature`::
  This element contains the following information about the signature if
  the method: +

Packaging a Component's Event Providers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Packaging a component's event providers enables the monitoring
infrastructure of GlassFish Server to discover the event providers
automatically.

To package a component's event providers, add an entry to the
component's `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file that identifies all of the
component's event providers. The format of the entry depends on how the
event providers are defined:

* If the event providers are defined as Java classes, the entry is a
list of the event providers' class names as follows: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
probe-provider-class-names : class-list
----
The `class-list` is a comma-separated list of the fully qualified Java
class names of the component's event providers.
* If the event providers are defined as XML fragments, the entry is a
list of the paths to the files that contain the XML fragments as
follows: +

Sending an Event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At runtime, your add-on component might perform an operation that
generates statistics. To provide statistics about the operation to
GlassFish Server, your component must send an event of the correct type
when performing the operation.

To send an event, instantiate your event provider class and invoke the
method of the event provider class for the type of the event.
Instantiate the class and invoke the method in the class that represents
your add-on component. Ensure that the method is invoked when your
component performs the operation for which the event was defined. One
way to meet this requirement is to invoke the method for sending the
event in the body of the method for performing the operation.

[[GSACG00044]][[ghpus]]


Example 5-4 Sending an Event

This example shows the code for instantiating the `TxManager` class and
invoking the `onTxBegin` method to send an event of type `begin`. This
event indicates that a component is about to begin a transaction.

The `TxManager` class is instantiated in the constructor of the
`TransactionManagerImpl` class. To ensure that the event is sent at the
correct time, the `onTxBegin` method is invoked in the body of the
`begin` method, which starts a transaction.

The declaration of the `onTxBegin` method in the event provider
interface is shown in link:#ghprw[Example 5-1].

[[ghplw]][[GSACG00117]][[updating-the-monitorable-object-tree]]

Updating the Monitorable Object Tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A monitorable object is a component, subcomponent, or service that can
be monitored. GlassFish Server uses a tree structure to track
monitorable objects.

Because the tree is dynamic, the tree changes as components of the
GlassFish Server instance are added, modified, or removed. Objects are
also added to or removed from the tree in response to configuration
changes. For example, if monitoring for a component is turned off, the
component's monitorable object is removed from the tree.

To enable system administrators to access statistics for all components
in the same way, you must provide statistics for an add-on component by
updating the monitorable object tree. Statistics for the add-on
component are then available through the GlassFish Server administrative
commands link:../reference-manual/get.html#GSRFM00139[`get`], olink:GSRFM00145[`list`], and
link:../reference-manual/set.html#GSRFM00226[`set`]. These commands locate an object in the tree
through the object's dotted name.

For more information about the tree structure of monitorable objects,
see "link:../administration-guide/monitoring.html#GSADG00727[How the Monitoring Tree Structure Works]" in
GlassFish Server Open Source Edition Administration Guide.

To make an add-on component a monitorable object, you must add the
add-on component to the monitorable object tree.

To update the statistics for an add-on component, you must add the
statistics to the monitorable object tree, and create event listeners to
gather statistics from events that represent these statistics. At
runtime, these listeners must update monitorable objects with statistics
that these events contain. The events are sent by event provider
classes. For information about how to create event provider classes and
send events, see link:#ghopc[Defining Statistics That Are to Be
Monitored].

Updating the monitorable object tree involves the following tasks:

* link:#ghpni[Creating Event Listeners]
* link:#ghptp[Representing a Component's Statistics in an Event Listener
Class]
* link:#ghpml[Subscribing to Events From Event Provider Classes]
* link:#ghppo[Registering an Event Listener]

[[ghpni]][[GSACG00222]][[creating-event-listeners]]

Creating Event Listeners
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An event listener gathers statistics from events that an event provider
sends. To enable an add-on component to gather statistics from events,
create listeners to receive events from the event provider. The listener
can receive events from the add-on component in which the listener is
created and from other components.

To create an event listener, write a Java class to represent the
listener. The listener can be any Java object.

An event listener also represents a component's statistics. To enable
the Application Server Management Extensions (AMX) to expose the
statistics to client applications, annotate the declaration of the class
with the `org.glassfish.gmbal.ManagedObject` annotation.

Ensure that the class that you write meets these requirements:

* The return value of all callback methods in the listener must be void.
* Because the methods of your event provider class may be entered by
multiple threads, the listener must be thread safe. However,GlassFish
Server provides utility classes to perform some common operations such
as `count`, `avg`, and `sum`.
* The listener must have the same restrictions as a Java Platform,
Enterprise Edition (Java EE) application. For example, the listener
cannot open server sockets, or create threads.

A listener is called in the same thread as the event method. As a
result, the listener can use thread locals. If the monitored system
allows access to thread locals, the listener can access thread locals of
the monitored system.


[width="100%",cols="<100%",]
|=======================================================================
a|
Note:

A listener that is not registered to listen for events is never called
by the framework. Therefore, unregistered listeners do not consume any
computing resources, such as memory or processor cycles.

|=======================================================================


[[ghptp]][[GSACG00223]][[representing-a-components-statistics-in-an-event-listener-class]]

Representing a Component's Statistics in an Event Listener Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Represent each statistic as the property of a JavaBeans specification
getter method of your listener class. Methods in the listener class for
processing events can then access the property through the getter
method. For more information, see link:#ghpml[Subscribing to Events From
Event Provider Classes].

To enable AMX to expose the statistic to client applications, annotate
the declaration of the getter method with the
`org.glassfish.gmbal.ManagedAttribute` annotation. Set the `id` element
of the `@ManagedAttribute` annotation to the property name all in
lowercase.

The data type of the property that represents a statistic must be a
class that provides methods for computing the statistic from event data.

The `org.glassfish.external.statistics.impl` package provides the
following classes to gather and compute statistics data:

`AverageRangeStatisticImpl`::
  Provides standard measurements of the lowest and highest values that
  an attribute has held and the current value of the attribute.
`BoundaryStatisticImpl`::
  Provides standard measurements of the upper and lower limits of the
  value of an attribute.
`BoundedRangeStatisticImpl`::
  Aggregates the attributes of `RangeStatisticImpl` and
  `BoundaryStatisticImpl` and provides standard measurements of a range
  that has fixed limits.
`CountStatisticImpl`::
  Provides standard count measurements.
`RangeStatisticImpl`::
  Provides standard measurements of the lowest and highest values that
  an attribute has held and the current value of the attribute.
`StatisticImpl`::
  Provides performance data.
`StringStatisticImpl`::
  Provides a string equivalent of a counter statistic.

Subscribing to Events From Event Provider Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To receive events from event provider classes, a listener must subscribe
to the events. Subscribing to events also specifies the provider and the
type of events that the listener will receive.

To subscribe to events from event provider classes, write one method in
your listener class to process each type of event. To specify the
provider and the type of event, annotate the method with the
`org.glassfish.external.probe.provider.annotations.ProbeListener`
annotation. In the `@ProbeListener` annotation, specify the provider and
the type as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----

Listening for Events From Classes That Are Not Event Providers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

gfProbes infrastructure allows clients to monitor glassfish even in the
absence of provider classes. This is done by allowing clients to receive
callbacks when a java methods are entered / exited. Note that while this
approach allows a client to monitor legacy code, it may not always be
possible to receive "high-level" events.

For example, while it is easy to monitor (through gfProbes) when
TransactionManagerImpl.begin() entered / exited, the client cannot
determine the transaction ID in this case.

[[ghppo]][[GSACG00226]][[registering-an-event-listener]]

Registering an Event Listener
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Registering an event listener enables the listener to receive callbacks
from the GlassFish Server event infrastructure. The listener can then
collect data from events and update monitorable objects in the object
tree. These monitorable objects form the basis for monitoring
statistics.

Registering an event listener also makes a component and its statistics
monitorable objects by adding statistics for the component to the
monitorable object tree.

At runtime, the GlassFish Server event infrastructure registers
listeners for an event provider when the event provider is started and
unregisters them when the event provider is shut down. As a result,
listeners have no dependencies on other components.

To register a listener, invoke the static
`org.glassfish.external.probe.provider.StatsProviderManager.register`
method in the class that represents your add-on component. In the method
invocation, pass the following information as parameters:

* The name of the configuration element with which all statistics in the
event listener are to be associated. System administrators use this
element for enabling or disabling monitoring for the event listener.
* The node in the monitorable object tree under which the event listener
is to be registered. To specify the node, pass one of the following
constants of the
`org.glassfish.external.probe.provider.PluginPointPluginPoint`
enumeration:

** To register the listener under the `server/applications` node, pass
the `APPLICATIONS` constant.

** To register the listener under the `server` node, pass the `SERVER`
constant.
* The path through the monitorable object tree from the node under which
the event listener is registered down to the statistics in the event
listener. The nodes in this path are separated by the slash (`/`)
character.
* The listener object that you are registering.

Example 5-7 Registering an Event Listener

This example shows the code for registering the event listener
`TxListener` for the add-on component that is represented by the class
`TransactionManagerImpl`. The statistics that are defined in this
listener are associated with the `web-container` configuration element.
The listener is registered under the `server/applications` node. The
path from this node to the statistics in the event listener is
`tx/txapp`.

Code for the constructor of the `TxListener` class is beyond the scope
of this example.

Dotted Names and REST URLs for an Add-On Component's Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GlassFish Server administrative subcommands link:../reference-manual/get.html#GSRFM00139[`get`],
link:../reference-manual/list.html#GSRFM00145[`list`], and olink:GSRFM00226[`set`] locate a statistic
through the dotted name of the statistic. The dotted name of a statistic
for an add-on component is determined from the registration of the event
listener that defines the statistic as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
listener-parent-node.path-to-statistic.statistic-name
----

listener-parent-node::
  The node in the monitorable object tree under which the event listener
  that defines the statistic is registered. This node is passed in the
  invocation of the `register` method that registers the event listener.
  For more information, see link:#ghppo[Registering an Event Listener].
path-to-statistic::
  The path through the monitorable object tree from the node under which
  the event listener is registered down to the statistic in the event
  listener in which each slash is replaced with a period. This path is
  passed in the invocation of the `register` method that registers the
  event listener. For more information, see link:#ghppo[Registering an
  Event Listener].
statistic-name::
  The name of the statistic. This name is the value of the `id` element
  of the `@ManagedAttribute` annotation on the property that represents
  the statistic. For more information, see link:#ghptp[Representing a
  Component's Statistics in an Event Listener Class].

For example, the dotted name of the `txcount` statistic that is defined
in link:#ghpsc[Example 5-5] and registered in link:#ghpuu[Example 5-7]
is as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
server.applications.tx.txapp.txcount
----

The formats of the URL to a REST resource that represents a statistic is
as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
http://host:port/monitoring/domain/path
----

host::
  The host where the DAS is running.
port::
  The HTTP port or HTTPS port for administration.
path::
  The path to the statistic. The path is the dotted name of the
  attribute in which each dot (`.`) is replaced with a slash (`/`).

For example, the URL the REST resource for the `txcount` statistic that
is defined in link:#ghpsc[Example 5-5] and registered in
link:#ghpuu[Example 5-7] is as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain/server/applications/tx/txapp/txcount
----

In this example, the DAS is running on the local host and the HTTP port
for administration is 4848.

Adding a Type to the `monitor` Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a type to the `monitor` command, implement the `MonitorContract`
interface.

An implementation of the `MonitorContract` interface is an HK2 service
that provides monitoring data to the `monitor` command.

Example 5-8 Event Provider Class

This example illustrates how to define an event provider as explained in
link:#ghovq[Defining an Event Provider by Writing a Java Class].

The example shows the definition of the `ModuleProbeProvider` class. The
event provider sends events when the request count is increased by 1 or
decreased by 1.

This class defines the following methods:

* `moduleCountIncrementEvent`
* `moduleCountDecrementEvent`

The name of each method is also the name of the event type that is
associated with the method.

A parameter that is named `count` is passed to each method.
