### GlassFish 7.0.16

GlassFish 7.0.16 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs. It compiles and runs on JDK 11 to JDK 21. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.

GlassFish 7.0.16 compiles and passes all internal tests using OpenJDK 21. The Jakarta EE 10 TCKs passed on JDK 21 as well. The Jakarta EE 10 TCK as a whole is now also JDK 21 compatible and it's possible to run all the Jakarta EE TCK tests.

In this summer 2024 release of GlassFish we added several new features. Specifically new is an admin command logger, which logs graphical interactions with the admin UI for usage in scripts. GlassFish now also allows resource references in persistence.xml, and we added a great new feature where we are creating temporary snapshots of the external application libraries during application startup, so any update of these is not longer system dependent. We also did a major refactoring of the aging TLS code and optimized the GJULE logging.

In the release for this month we replaced many synchronized blocks by reentrant locks (to accommodate JDK 21 virtual threads).

We also looked at SSO between clusters, and fixed a long standing bug there.

A long running investigation into potential resource leaks finally came to a conclusion, and resulted in many fixes throughout the code base. The admin console also saw various improvements, specifically with respect to loading.

### GlassFish 7.0.12

GlassFish 7.0.12 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs. It compiles and runs on JDK 11 to JDK 21. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.

GlassFish 7.0.12 compiles and passes all internal tests using OpenJDK 21. Several Jakarta EE 10 TCKs passed on JDK 21 as well. The Jakarta EE 10 TCK as a whole is not JDK 21 compatible and it's not possible to run all the Jakarta EE TCK tests.

This release we focused on finding and fixing the root cause of several "strange" WebSocket related bugs that we witnessed in the past. We also did a similar thing related to several issues with running apps on the default context root, especially where after authentication redirects happened to another URL.

Furthermore we looked into problems with authentication and SSO in a cluster and did some initial fixes. Handling and processing of logging was looked at once again, something we have been improving a lot step by step through various iterations of releases.

Finally but not least a nasty ConcurrentModificationException was fixed, and a memory leak (via HK2) was solved.

This release sees an important fix where WebSockets would not work at all for applications on the default context root (e.g. https://example.com vs https://example.com/myapp).

This month we have concentrated on the AdminGUI and fixed an assortment of small but annoying defects in it. Various major components were updated, such as Jersey (Jakarta REST), Tyrus (Jakarta WebSockets) and Mojarra (Jakarta Faces).

To keep the project maintainable and well tested, several tests were added and improved as well.

### GlassFish 7.0.10

GlassFish 7.0.10 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs. It compiles and runs on JDK 11 to JDK 21. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.

This release is the second GlassFish release after OpenJDK 21 was released. GlassFish 7.0.10 compiles and passes all internal tests using OpenJDK 21. Several Jakarta EE 10 TCKs passed on JDK 21 as well. The Jakarta EE 10 TCK as a whole is not JDK 21 compatible and it's not possible to run all the Jakarta EE TCK tests.

In this release a 10 months long operation to get an internal dependency to the slf4j-api removed finally got to fruition. This involved the intense cooperation of multiple teams, and we're exceptionally happy to have finally been able to do this.

We also did a lot of work to make our builds repeatable, and we did a ton of refactoring to the internal security packages of GlassFish, making them easier to understand and therefore easier to maintain. Any external code depending on these internal packages (such as potentially custom LoginModules/Realms) may have to update (we recommend of course not depending on internal packages and using public APIs).

As every release, we integrated many component updates, and did a number of smaller fixes.

In this release the modularity of GlassFish is once again increased by moving the Jakarta Authentication implementation code to a new standalone project: [Epicyro](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/epicyro). We also enabled the GlassFish embedded tests again, which were dormant for a long time. Among the many updated components, Exousia was updated specifically to fix a bug with deployments on virtual servers, and the ORB was updated to fix a somewhat obscure bug where a remote EJB returned a JDK defined enum type.
