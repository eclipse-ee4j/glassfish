== 17 Using the Java Message Service

This chapter describes how to use the Java Message Service (JMS) API.
The {productName} has a fully integrated JMS provider: the
Open Message Queue software.


[NOTE]
====
JMS resources are supported only in the full {productName}, not in
the Web Profile.
====


For information about the JMS, see
https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-tutorial/#messaging[Messaging]
in The Jakarta EE Tutorial.

For detailed information about JMS concepts and JMS support in the
{productName}, see "xref:administration-guide.adoc#administering-the-java-message-service-jms[Administering the Java Message
Service (JMS)]" in {productName} Administration
Guide.

[[using-application-scoped-jms-resources]]

=== Using Application-Scoped JMS Resources

You can define an application-scoped JMS or other resource for an
enterprise application, web module, EJB module, connector module, or
application client module by supplying a `glassfish-resources.xml`
deployment descriptor file. For details, see
"xref:application-deployment-guide.adoc#application-scoped-resources[Application-Scoped Resources]" in {productName} Application Deployment Guide.

[[load-balanced-message-inflow]]

=== Load-Balanced Message Inflow

You can configure `ActivationSpec` properties of the `jmsra` resource
adapter in the `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` file for a message-driven bean
using `activation-config-property` elements. Whenever a message-driven
bean (`EndPointFactory`) is deployed, the connector runtime engine finds
these properties and configures them accordingly in the resource
adapter. See "xref:application-deployment-guide.adoc#activation-config-property[activation-config-property]" in {productName} Application Deployment Guide.

The {productName} transparently enables messages to be delivered in
random fashion to message-driven beans having same `ClientID`. The
`ClientID` is required for durable subscribers.

For nondurable subscribers in which the `ClientID` is not configured,
all instances of a specific message-driven bean that subscribe to same
topic are considered equal. When a message-driven bean is deployed to
multiple instances of the {productName}, only one of the
message-driven beans receives the message. If multiple distinct
message-driven beans subscribe to same topic, one instance of each
message-driven bean receives a copy of the message.

To support multiple consumers using the same queue, set the
`maxNumActiveConsumers` property of the physical destination to a large
value. If this property is set, the Oracle Message Queue software allows
multiple message-driven beans to consume messages from same queue. The
message is delivered randomly to the message-driven beans. If
`maxNumActiveConsumers` is set to `-1`, there is no limit to the number
of consumers.

To ensure that local delivery is preferred, set `addresslist-behavior`
to `priority`. This setting specifies that the first broker in the
`AddressList` is selected first. This first broker is the local
colocated Message Queue instance. If this broker is unavailable,
connection attempts are made to brokers in the order in which they are
listed in the `AddressList`. This setting is the default for {productName} instances that belong to a cluster.

[[authentication-with-connectionfactory]]

=== Authentication With `ConnectionFactory`

If your web, EJB, or client module has `res-auth` set to `Container`,
but you use the `ConnectionFactory.createConnection("user","password")`
method to get a connection, the {productName} searches the container
for authentication information before using the supplied user and
password. Version 7 of the {productName} threw an exception in this
situation.

[[delivering-soap-messages-using-the-jms-api]]

=== Delivering SOAP Messages Using the JMS API

Web service clients use the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) to
communicate with web services. SOAP uses a combination of XML-based data
structuring and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to define a
standardized way of invoking methods in objects distributed in diverse
operating environments across the Internet.

For more information about SOAP, see the Apache SOAP web site at
`http://xml.apache.org/soap/index.html`.

You can take advantage of the JMS provider's reliable messaging when
delivering SOAP messages. You can convert a SOAP message into a JMS
message, send the JMS message, then convert the JMS message back into a
SOAP message.

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#to-send-soap-messages-using-the-jms-api[To Send SOAP Messages Using the JMS API]
* xref:#to-receive-soap-messages-using-the-jms-api[To Receive SOAP Messages Using the JMS API]

[[to-send-soap-messages-using-the-jms-api]]

==== To Send SOAP Messages Using the JMS API

1. Import the `MessageTransformer` library.
+
[source,java]
----
import com.sun.messaging.xml.MessageTransformer;
----
This is the utility whose methods you use to convert SOAP messages to
JMS messages and the reverse. You can then send a JMS message containing
a SOAP payload as if it were a normal JMS message.
2. Initialize the `TopicConnectionFactory`, `TopicConnection`,
`TopicSession`, and publisher.
+
[source,java]
----
tcf = new TopicConnectionFactory();
tc = tcf.createTopicConnection();
session = tc.createTopicSession(false,Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
topic = session.createTopic(topicName);
publisher = session.createPublisher(topic);
----
3. Construct a SOAP message using the SOAP with Attachments API for
Java (SAAJ).
+
[source,java]
----
/*construct a default soap MessageFactory */
MessageFactory mf = MessageFactory.newInstance();
* Create a SOAP message object.*/
SOAPMessage soapMessage = mf.createMessage();
/** Get SOAP part.*/
SOAPPart soapPart = soapMessage.getSOAPPart();
/* Get SOAP envelope. */
SOAPEnvelope soapEnvelope = soapPart.getEnvelope();
/* Get SOAP body.*/
SOAPBody soapBody = soapEnvelope.getBody();
/* Create a name object. with name space */
/* http://www.sun.com/imq. */
Name name = soapEnvelope.createName("HelloWorld", "hw",
 "http://www.sun.com/imq");
* Add child element with the above name. */
SOAPElement element = soapBody.addChildElement(name)
/* Add another child element.*/
element.addTextNode( "Welcome to GlassFish Web Services." );
/* Create an atachment with activation API.*/
URL url = new URL ("http://java.sun.com/webservices/");
DataHandler dh = new DataHandler (url);
AttachmentPart ap = soapMessage.createAttachmentPart(dh);
/*set content type/ID. */
ap.setContentType("text/html");
ap.setContentId("cid-001");
/** add the attachment to the SOAP message.*/
soapMessage.addAttachmentPart(ap);
soapMessage.saveChanges();
----
4. Convert the SOAP message to a JMS message by calling the
`MessageTransformer.SOAPMessageintoJMSMessage()` method.
+
[source,java]
----
Message m = MessageTransformer.SOAPMessageIntoJMSMessage (soapMessage, session );
----
5. Publish the JMS message.
+
[source,java]
----
publisher.publish(m);
----
6. Close the JMS connection.
+
[source,java]
----
tc.close();
----

[[to-receive-soap-messages-using-the-jms-api]]

==== To Receive SOAP Messages Using the JMS API

1. Import the `MessageTransformer` library.
+
[source,java]
----
import com.sun.messaging.xml.MessageTransformer;
----
This is the utility whose methods you use to convert SOAP messages to
JMS messages and the reverse. The JMS message containing the SOAP
payload is received as if it were a normal JMS message.
2. Initialize the `TopicConnectionFactory`, `TopicConnection`,
`TopicSession`, `TopicSubscriber`, and Topic.
+
[source,java]
----
messageFactory = MessageFactory.newInstance();
tcf = new com.sun.messaging.TopicConnectionFactory();
tc = tcf.createTopicConnection();
session = tc.createTopicSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
topic = session.createTopic(topicName);
subscriber = session.createSubscriber(topic);
subscriber.setMessageListener(this);
tc.start();
----
3. Use the `OnMessage` method to receive the message. Use the
`SOAPMessageFromJMSMessage` method to convert the JMS message to a SOAP
message.
+
[source,java]
----
public void onMessage (Message message) {
SOAPMessage soapMessage = MessageTransformer.SOAPMessageFromJMSMessage(message, messageFactory );
}
----
4. Retrieve the content of the SOAP message.
