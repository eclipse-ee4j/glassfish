This book demonstrates key features of the {productName} product and
enables you to quickly learn the basics. Step-by-step procedures
introduce you to product features and enable you to use them
immediately.

This preface contains information about and conventions for the entire
{productName} ({productName}) documentation
set.

{productName} 7 is developed through the GlassFish project
open-source community at `https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish`. The
GlassFish project provides a structured process for developing the
{productName} platform that makes the new features of the Jakarta EE
platform available faster, while maintaining the most important feature
of Jakarta EE: compatibility. It enables Java developers to access the
{productName} source code and to contribute to the development of the
{productName}. The GlassFish project is designed to encourage
communication between Oracle engineers and the community.
