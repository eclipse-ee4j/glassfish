# Properties for establishing initial JNDI Context. These properties
# are automatically read by JNDI during new InitialContext() as long
# as this file is in the search path. For JMS TCK the Open Message
# Queue uses the JNDI FileSystem Context Provider. 
#
# If on a WINDOWS based system then the path below will need to contain 
# the drive letter in the path. The path below is for UNIX based systems.
# So for WINDOWS platforms the (java.naming.provider.url) MUST BE:
# java.naming.provider.url=file:///C:/tmp/ri_admin_objects
#
java.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory
java.naming.provider.url=file:///tmp/ri_admin_objects
