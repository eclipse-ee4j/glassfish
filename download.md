## Eclipse GlassFish 7.x

GlassFish 7.0.15 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs. It compiles and runs on JDK 11 to JDK 21. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.

GlassFish 7.0.15 compiles and passes all internal tests using OpenJDK 21. Several Jakarta EE 10 TCKs passed on JDK 21 as well. The Jakarta EE 10 TCK as a whole is not JDK 21 compatible and it's not possible to run all the Jakarta EE TCK tests. 

In this release we updated and thoroughly tested a lot of important components, including Exousia (Security), Mojarra (Faces), Jersey (REST) and Yasson/Parsson (JSON).

Testing has been improved by fixing a number of issues within the tests itself.

Finally, we fixed a number of errors in the documentation.
