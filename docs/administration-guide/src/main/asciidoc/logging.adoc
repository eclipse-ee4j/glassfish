== 7 Administering the Logging Service

This chapter provides instructions on how to configure logging and how
to view log information in the {productName} 7 environment.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<About Logging>>
* <<Default Configuration>>
* <<Configuring the Logging Service>>
* <<Using Asadmin>>

[[about-logging]]

=== About Logging

Logging is the process by which Java Virtual Machine
captures information about events that occur, such as important method calls,
reaching states, or even configuration errors, security failures, or server malfunction.

This data is recorded in log files and is usually the first source
of information when problems occur.
Analyzing the log files can help you to follow events that occur
in the server runtime and determine the overall health of the server.

Although application components can use other logging frameworks as
`https://www.slf4j.org/[SLF4J]` or `https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[LOG4J2]`,
we recommend to use the
`https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.logging/java/util/logging/package-summary.html[Java Util Logging Framework]`
or even better it's latest facade
`https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/System.Logger.html[System.Logger]`.

[[log-manager]]
==== Log Manager

Log Manager is a service responsible for the logging system.
The service is initialized on JVM startup.
After it's first usage it cannot be changed until the JVM is restarted,
but it can be reconfigured.
{productName} now comes with customized log manager.

[[level]]
==== Level

Level is the key feature of the logging system. Every JUL <<Logger>> has an internal
integer value representing severity.
Levels are set to

* <<Log Record>> as the severity level of the record.
* <<Logger>> as the minimal severity level processed by the logger. Log record with lower severity is ignored.
* <<Handler>> as the minimal severity level processed by the handler. Log record with lower severity is ignored.

There are following predefined levels; however the real usage depends on developers:

* ALL - Special level used by loggers and handlers to declare that they accept all levels.
* SEVERE - Used for serious errors.
* WARNING - Used for log records providing an information about some hazards which
can be handled by the application or they can even lead to a severe state.
* INFO - Used to log some important information useful even for the user.
* CONFIG - Used for providing an information related to a configuration.
* FINE - Level for tracing. Used for providing an information about internal behavior
of the java application, but still not so detailed.
* FINER - Level for tracing. More detailed information, for example usages
of `Logger.entering` and `Logger.exiting` methods.
* FINEST - Level for tracing. Usually very verbose messages slowing down the system
but providing a complete information what is going on.
* OFF - Special level used by loggers and handlers to declare that they ignore all levels.

Some projects define custom levels, but at this time it is rather rare.

[[log-record]]
==== Log Record

Log Record is an object created by a <<Logger>> or it's caller and sent
to the hierarchy of loggers and handlers which will process it.
Every time you use the Logger object to log a message with a level passing
configured level filters, one LogRecord instance is created and processed.

[[logger]]
==== Logger

Logger is a facade of the logging system. It is transparent so it can be
initialized as a constant. Logger name is usually same as the full name of
the class which created it, but specialized loggers can be used too.

Loggers are organized in a tree, so the log record is usually processed by
the logger which accepted or created it, then passed to the parent logger (parent package),
it's parent, etc. unless it is configured to not to do so.

The logger log level specifies a severity level to filter what is important for the user.
There are several special loggers:

* root logger - uses an empty string as a name.
* system root logger - uses an empty string as a name too, but is not accessible outside JDK, which uses it internally.
* global logger - uses `global` as it's name. It is not recommended to use it.


==== Handler

Handler is responsible for handling the record so it can print the record
to the standard output, file, e-mail, network, etc.
Handler have also it's own level set. This level serves as a filter of
incomming log records - usually it is not desired to send detailed messages
to an e-mail, for example.

==== Formatter

Formatter is responsible for formatting of the log record to a String
object. It is a usual attribute of the handler, but not all handlers use
formatters, for example some handlers may just serialize the log record,
call the logging system of the operating system or call a web service.

==== Configuration

JUL is usually configured by the `logging.properties` file unless you would use different
log manager or you use the JVM option `java.util.logging.config.file` to override it.


[[defaults]]

=== Default Configuration

[[logging-properties]]

==== The Configuration File

The DAS as well as each configuration, instance, and cluster has its own `logging properties` file.
By default in an {productName} domain, logging properties files are created in the following locations:

[width="100%",cols="18%,82%",options="header",]
|===
|Target |Default Location of Logging Properties File
|DAS |domain-dir``/config/logging.properties``

|A configuration |domain-dir``/config/``config-name``/logging.properties``,
where config-name represents the name of a configuration that is shared
by one or more instances or clusters.

|An instance
|domain-dir``/config/``instance-name``-config/logging.properties``, where
instance-name represents the name of the instance.

|A cluster
|domain-dir``/config/``cluster-name``-config/logging.properties``, where
cluster-name represents the name of the cluster.
|===


For information about configuring logging properties, see
<<Configuring the Logging Service>>.

==== The Server Log File

By default {productName} log records are captured in the `server.log` file which
can be found in the `logs` directory under the instance's directory.
Each instance, managed server instance (that is, each cluster member),
and the domain administration server (DAS) has an individual server log file.

This file will contain also logs of deployed applications if they use
Java Util Logging, System.Logger or any other facade mapped to this logging
system in the backend.

[width="100%",cols="40%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Instance |Default Location
|DAS |domain-dir``/logs/server.log``
|Each server instance |instance-dir``/logs/server.log``
|Cluster instance |instance-dir``/logs/server.log``
|===

For example, in a domain hosted on a given machine that includes a
cluster with two managed servers (`ClusterServer1` and `ClusterServer1`)
and a standalone instance (`StandaloneServer`), the log files might be
arranged in the following directory structure. In this directory
structure, the `server.log` file for the DAS is located in
domain-dir``/logs``.

[source]
----
as-install-parent directory
  glassfish/
    domains/
      domain-dir/
        logs/
          server.log
    nodes/
      hostname/
        ClusterServer1/
          logs/
            server.log
        ClusterServer2/
          logs/
            server.log
        StandaloneServer/
          logs/
            server.log
----

The `server.log` file uses the <<ODL>> log format by default and is
rolled to a new file after it's size exceeds 100 Megabytes. If something
in server's JVM prints to the standard output stream or standard
error stream, it is redirected to the `server.log` file.

You can change the default name, location, formatting or management of a log
file by modifying the `logging properties` file for the corresponding instance,
however we don't recommend to change the location of the file as it may affect
availability of some services.

==== The Access Log File

The `access.log` file serves to log all requests made to the HTTP service or
virtual server. This feature is disabled by default, but you can enable it by
using the asadmin set command, using Admininistration Console or the Admin REST API.

This logging feature is not persisted in logging.properties but in domain.xml, because
it doesn't use Java Util Logging framework but an internal implementation instead.

server.http-service.access-log.write-interval-seconds=300
server.http-service.access-logging-enabled=false
----

==== Standard Output Stream

When you start the server with the `--verbose` argument, the server prints log
records to the standard output too.
The output is limited to just INFO levels and higher and uses the standard error stream,
but this can be switched to standard output stream too.
Log records are formatted to the xref:UniformLogFormatter[Uniform Log Format]] by default.

==== Logger Levels

The `logging.properties` contains many loggers used by the {productName} to make changes easier.
Most of loggers use the INFO level by default.

[[configuring]]

=== Configuring the Logging Service

You can either directly edit the `logging.properties` file or use the asadmin command,
Administration Console or REST API.
On DAS, changes in the file have immediate effect with some small latency before they get applied.
For instances managed by nodes it is a bit more complicated and it depends
on the synchronization of the configuration with DAS.

[[configuring-warning]]
[WARNING]
====
If you edit `logging.properties` manually on an instance managed by the node, it will be
overwritten on the next synchronization with DAS.
====


[[loggers]]

==== Loggers

Changing the logger level is quite easy and it is a preferred way how to filter log records
by their importance.

So for example if you want to get all records handled by the logging
system, you comment out all logger level settings except the root logger and set it's level
to `FINEST`.

----
.level=FINEST
----

[[handlers]]

==== Handlers

You can use all JUL features, but some of {productName} features depend on some settings
like the existence of the configured <<GlassFishLogHandler>>
and it's `server.log` file.
Also be careful when changing it's configuration as it may affect the performance.

[[GlassFishLogHandler]]
===== GlassFishLogHandler

The `org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler` is used to handle persist log records
into the `server.log` file. It is optimized for the best performance so logging would not
reduce the performance of the server instance and applications deployed to it.

Example:
----
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.buffer.capacity=10000
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.buffer.timeoutInSeconds=0
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.enabled=true
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.encoding=UTF-8
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.file=${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/logs/server.log
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.flushFrequency=1
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.formatter=org.glassfish.main.jul.formatter.ODLLogFormatter
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.formatter.excludedFields=
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.formatter.multiline=true
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.formatter.printSource=false
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.level=ALL
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.redirectStandardStreams=true
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.rotation.compress=false
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.rotation.maxArchiveFiles=0
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.rotation.limit.megabytes=100
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.rotation.limit.minutes=0
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.rotation.rollOnDateChange=false
----

[[basic-settings]]
====== Basic Settings

* `enabled` - `false` means that the handler will stay configured in the logging system,
but it will ignore incoming records. Default is `true`.
* `encoding` - file's character encoding. Default is `UTF-8`.
* `file` - the output file; you can use also system options - default is `${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/logs/server.log`
* `flushFrequency` - count of records to be handled in a single batch. Default is 1.
* `formatter` - a formatter class to be used for formatting log records as strings.
Default value is xref:ODL[`org.glassfish.main.jul.formatter.ODLLogFormatter`]
* `formatter.*` - can be used for custom settings of the formatter.
This works only for <<ODLLogFormatter>>, <<UniformLogFormatter>> and <<OneLineFormatter>>.
* `level` - Level used to filter log records. Less important log records will be ignored.
Default is `ALL`.
* `redirectStandardStreams` - if `true`, which is default, everything printed
to the standard output stream and standard error stream is processed by the handler
as an INFO resp. ERROR log record. While using these streams is not recommended in
Jakarta EE applications, it should be rather rare.

====== Receive Buffer

The `GlassFishLogHandler` has a receive buffer for incomming log records to optimize throughput.
If the buffer is full and a logger tries to add another record, logger's thread is blocked.
Then if the timeout is set to 0, the thread is blocked until there's free capacity available
- if the handler cannot process records, it may be blocked forever.
But if you set the timeout to a positive value, and the thread is blocked for longer time,
the whole buffer is reset and added is just an error record describing what happened.

Despite this situation should not occur in standard situation, it may happen ie. when
the file system stops working or is extremely slow.

* `buffer.capacity` - count of records in the receive buffer, default is 10000 log records.
* `buffer.timeoutInSeconds` - maximal time for waiting. Default is 0 which means forever.
The buffer is reset after timeout, which means that all unprocessible log records are lost.

[[log-file-rotation]]
====== Log File Rotation

The `GlassFishLogHandler` can roll the output log file under following conditions:

* if user forced him to do so, see <<To Rotate Log Files Manually>> for more
* if the size of the file exceeded given limit
* if the date changed
* if the specified number of minutes have passed since the file was opened

The last two conditions are exclusive, the date change has higher priority.

The <<`flushFrequency`>> parameter affects how many log records will be formatted
into the log file before the file is rolled out even after the file size exceeded it's configured
limit.

The rotation means that the log file is renamed, so the new file name gets
a current timestamp as a suffix.
If there already is a file with the same name, the implementation tries to add another suffix
with a counter until it finds a name which doesn't exist yet.

----
drwxrwxr-x 14 admin admin   4096 čec 29 21:21 ../
-rw-rw-r--  1 admin admin   2521 srp  3 18:18 server.log
-rw-rw-r--  1 admin admin 191391 čec 29 21:21 server.log_2022-07-29T21-21-54
-rw-rw-r--  1 admin admin  24920 srp  3 18:18 server.log_2022-08-03T18-18-38
----

You can configure the logging service to change the default settings for
log file rotation, as explained in <<Setting Log File Rotation>>.


This is a list of related configuration properties:

* `rotation.compress` - compress the rotated file using GZIP algorithm provided by JDK. Default is false.
* `rotation.maxArchiveFiles` - maximal count of archived log files (excludes the active one).
Default is 0, which means unlimited.
* `rotation.limit.megabytes` - size of the file initiating rotation of the file.
Default is 100 Megabytes. The final file will be slightly larger.
* `rotation.limit.minutes` - number of minutes since the last rotation. Default is 0 (unlimited, disabled).
* `rotation.rollOnDateChange` - if set to `true` rolls the file at midnight. Default is `false`.

[[SimpleLogHandler]]
===== SimpleLogHandler

The `org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.SimpleLogHandler` has similar targets as the
`https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.logging/java/util/logging/ConsoleHandler.html[`ConsoleHandler`]`,
with few differences:

* can be configured to use STDOUT instead of STDERR
* uses <<OneLineFormatter>> by default

The handler configuration properties:

* `encoding` - output character encoding. Default is null which means it will use the system default.
* `formatter` - a formatter class to be used for formatting log records as strings.
Default value is <<`org.glassfish.main.jul.formatter.OneLineFormatter`>>
* `formatter.*` - can be used for custom settings of the formatter.
This works only for <<ODLLogFormatter>>, <<UniformLogFormatter>> and <<OneLineFormatter>>.
* `level` - Level used to filter log records. Less important log records will be ignored.
Uses `INFO` as a default.
* `useErrorStream` - if `false`, uses STDOUT instead of STDERR. Default is `true`.

Configuration example:
----
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.SimpleLogHandler.formatter=org.glassfish.main.jul.formatter.OneLineFormatter
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.SimpleLogHandler.formatter.printSource=false
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.SimpleLogHandler.level=INFO
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.SimpleLogHandler.useErrorStream=true
----

[[SyslogHandler]]
===== SyslogHandler

The `org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.SyslogHandler` is a special handler which is able to send
log records to the Unix Syslog facility. The prerequisity is that the Syslog service must
listen on the configured network endpoint.
See `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog[Syslog on Wikipedia.org]` for more.

The handler configuration properties:

* `buffer.capacity` - count of records in the receive buffer. Default is 5000 log records.
* `buffer.timeoutInSeconds` - maximal time for waiting. Default is 300.
The buffer is reset after timeout, which means that all unprocessible log records are lost.
* `enabled` - `false` means that the handler will stay configured in the logging system,
but it will ignore incoming records. Default is `true`.
* `encoding` - output character encoding used to send data to the Syslog service.
Default is `UTF-8`.
* `formatter` - a formatter class to be used for formatting log records as strings.
Default value is <<`java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter`>>
* `host` - a host name or IP address used of the UDP endpoint.
Default is an autodetected name of the local host.
* `level` - Level used to filter log records. Less important log records will be ignored.
The default level is `WARNING`.
* `port` - a port of the Syslog UDP listener. Default is 514.


Configuration example:
----
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.SyslogHandler.enabled=true
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.SyslogHandler.encoding=UTF-8
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.SyslogHandler.formatter=java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.SyslogHandler.host=
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.SyslogHandler.level=SEVERE
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.SyslogHandler.port=514

[[Simple]]
===== SimpleFormatter

The full name is `java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter`. It is a default formatter provided by the JDK,
simple but very flexible. It's most important property is `format`. Read the
`https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.logging/java/util/logging/SimpleFormatter.html[documentation of the SimpleFormatter class]`
for more.

[[asadmin]]
=== Using Asadmin

Each instance in an {productName} domain has a dedicated `server.log` file,
and each instance and cluster has its own `logging.properties` file.
To configure logging for an instance or a cluster,
{productName} allows you target specific log
files or logging properties files when you do the following:

* Set log levels
* Rotate `server.log` files or compress them into a ZIP archive
* Change logging property attributes
* List log levels or log attributes

The following subcommands optionally accept a target specification.
A target can be a configuration name, server name, cluster name, or instance name,
and is specified as either an operand or as a value
passed using the `--target` option.
If no target is specified when using any of these subcommands, the default target is the DAS.

This section contains the following examples:

* <<To Change the Location of the logging.properties File>>
* <<Setting Log Levels>>
* <<Setting the Log File Format>>
* <<Setting Log File Rotation>>

[[to-change-the-location-of-the-logging-properties-file]]

==== To Change the Location of the logging.properties File

You can set the name and location of the logging properties file by
setting the `java.util.logging.config.file` system property.

[WARNING]
====
You have to ensure that the output log file is always used by a single instance.
In the default logging.properties it is ensured by using the ${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}
which always resolves to the instance's root directory. Example:
----
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.file=${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/logs/server.log
----
====

1. Set the `java.util.logging.config.file` system property.
+
[source]
----
asadmin create-jvm-options --target=server-config -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/logging.properties
----
Alternatively, you can use the Administration Console to set this system property.

2. To apply your change, restart all instances using this configuration. In our case it would be the DAS:

[[to-change-logfile-location]]

==== To Change the Location of the Log File

Even in complex domain you can always find the right `logging.properties` file and
update it manually. But probably safer is to use an asadmin command to do that.

To change the name and location of the log file, first use the `list-log-attributes` command
to obtain the current log attribute setting for the log file name and location.
Then use the `set-log-attributes` command to specify the new name or location.
The default target for these two commands is the DAS. However, you can
optionally specify one of the following targets:

* Configuration name — to target all instances or clusters that share a specific configuration name.
* Server name — to target only a specific server.
* Instance name — to target only a specific instance.
* Cluster name — to target only a specific cluster.

//-

1. Ensure that the DAS is running. Remote commands require a running server.

2. Use the xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-log-attributes[`list-log-attributes`]
command in remote mode to obtain the current log attribute settings.
The name and location of the log file is set with the
`org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.file` attribute of the
`logging properties` file.
Optionally you can target a configuration, server, instance, or cluster.
If you do not specify a target, the log attribute settings for the DAS are displayed.

3. Use the xref:reference-manual.adoc#set-log-attributes[`set-log-attributes`]
command in remote mode to define a custom name or location of the log file.
If you do not specify a target, the log file for the DAS is targeted by default.
If you target a cluster, the name of the cluster log file for
each member instance can be changed (the server log file name cannot).

[[example-7-1]]
Example 7-1 Changing the Name and Location of a Cluster's Log File

This example changes the name of the cluster log file for `Cluster1` to
`cluster1.log`. `Cluster1` has two server instances: `ClusterServer1` and `ClusterServer2`.

[[setting-log-levels]]

==== Setting Log Levels

The log level determines the granularity of the message as it is
described in the chapter <<Level>>.

When setting log levels, you can target a configuration,
server, instance, or cluster.

Setting log levels is done by using the `set-log-levels` subcommand.
Listing log levels is done by using the `list-log-levels` subcommand.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<To List Logger Levels>>
* <<To Set the Logger Log Level>>
* <<To Set the Handler Log Level>>

[[to-list-log-levels]]

===== To List Logger Levels

{productName} provides the means to list all loggers and their log levels.
Listing the loggers provides a convenient means to view current loggers
and log levels either prior to or after making log level changes.

Use the `list-log-levels` subcommand in remote mode to list the modules
and their current log levels.
The default target for this subcommand is the DAS.
However, you can optionally specify one of the following targets:

* Configuration name — to target all instances or clusters that share a specific configuration name.
* Server name — to target a specific server.
* Instance name — to target a specific instance.
* Cluster name — to target a specific cluster.

1. Ensure that the DAS is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. List the existing module loggers and log levels by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-log-levels[`list-log-levels`] subcommand.

[[example-7-2]]

[[to-set-the-logger-log-level]]

===== To Set the Logger Log Level

You will probably need to set logger levels most often.
Let's imagine that you would need to set the most verbose logging of an application
using the `org.acme` package (and logger names).

Then you can edit the `logging.properties` file directly, what can be quite
more complicated it you use more than one instance, see the xref:configuring-warning[warning].

Safer is to use the `set-log-levels` subcommand:
[[example-7-4]]
Example 7-5 Changing the Logger Log Level for a Cluster

You can view the full syntax and options of the subcommand by typing
`asadmin help set-log-levels` at the command line.


[[to-set-the-handler-log-level]]

===== To Set the Handler Log Level

The handler log level specifies a severity level filter to prevent overloading
of the handler. Default value is usually given by handler's implementation
and reflect targets and expected throughput of the handler.
For example, you would not want to send all `FINEST` LogRecords by e-mail,
but you would like to see them in a local log file.

Because JUL uses the same property syntax for <<Logger>> levels as
for <<Handler>> levels you can use both `set-log-levels` and `set-log-attributes`
subcommands to get the same result (with a bit different syntax).

Both commands in remote mode.
The default target for this subcommand is the DAS.
However, you can optionally specify one of the following targets using the `--target` option:

* Configuration name — to target all instances or clusters that share a specific configuration name.
* Server name — to target a specific server.
* Instance name — to target a specific instance.
* Cluster name — to target a specific cluster.

//-

1. Ensure that the DAS is running.
2. Set the log level by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#set-log-levels[`set-log-attributes`] subcommand,
specifying the log level of the `org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler` handler.
For example:
+
[source]
----
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler <ALL>
----

[[example-7-6]]
Example 7-6 Changing the Handler Log Level

This example sets the log level for `GlassFishLogHandler` in the DAS to `INFO`:

[[setting-the-log-file-format]]

==== Setting the Log File Format

You can set the format for log records in log files.
The following topics are addressed here:

* <<To Set the Log File Format>>
* <<To Exclude Fields in Logs>>
* <<To Disable Multiline Mode>>

[[to-set-the-log-file-format]]

===== To Set the Log File Format

Use the `set-log-file-format` subcommand in remote mode to set the
formatter used by {productName} to format log records in log files.
This command is limited to the `GlassFishLogHandler` settings.
You can also use the `set-log-attributes` subcommand which is more flexible.
Log formats for all server instances in a cluster will be the same.
For information about log formats, see <<Formatters>>.

[NOTE]
====
Changing the log format forces log rotation to avoid mixed format in the same file.
====

1. Ensure that the DAS is running. Remote commands require a running server.
2. Set the formatter by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#redeploy[`set-log-file-format`] subcommand.
3. To apply your change, restart affected instances or clusters with the synchronization enabled.

[[example-7-7]]
Example 7-7 Setting the Log File Format using `set-log-file-format`

This example sets the log file format to `OneLineFormatter` for standalone instance
`ManagedServer1` using the `set-log-file-format` subcommand.

[[to-exclude-fields-in-log-records]]

===== To Exclude Fields in Logs

Use the `set-log-attributes` subcommand in remote mode to exclude
specific name-value fields from log records. If the `excludeFields`
attribute is not specified, all name-value fields are included.
The following fields can be excluded:

* `tid`
* `levelVal`

//-

1. Ensure that the DAS is running. Remote commands require a running server.

2. Exclude fields by using the xref:reference-manual.adoc#set-log-attributes[`set-log-attributes`]
subcommand, specifying the attribute and the fields to exclude.

3. To apply your change, restart {productName}.

[[example-7-9]]
Example 7-9 Excluding Fields in the ODLLogFormatter

This example excludes the `tid` (thread ID and name) and `levelValue` (numerical value of the <<Level>>)

[[to-disable-multiline-mode]]

===== To Disable Multiline Mode

Use the `set-log-attributes` command in remote mode to disable the multiline mode.
When multiline mode is enabled (the default), the body of a log
message starts on a new line after the message header and is indented.

1. Ensure that the DAS is running. Remote commands require a running server.

2. Set multiline mode by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#set-log-attributes[`set-log-attributes`] subcommand,
specifying the formatter attribute and its value (`true` or `false`):

3. To apply your change, restart the instance.

[[example-7-11]]

[[setting-log-file-rotation]]

==== Setting Log File Rotation

As explained in <<The Server Log File>>, {productName} by default rotates
the `server.log` file when it's size exceeds 100 MB.
However, you can change the default rotation settings.
For example, you can change the file size limit at which the server
rotates the log file or you can configure a server to rotate log files based
on a time interval.
In addition to changing when rotation occurs, you can also:

* Specify the maximum number of rotated files that can accumulate.
By default, {productName} does not limit the number of rotated log files that are retained.
However, you can set a limit.
After the number of log files reaches this limit, subsequent file
rotations delete the oldest rotated log file.

* Rotate the log file manually.
A manual rotation forces the immediate rotation of the target log file.

Changing the default log rotation settings is done using the
`set-log-attributes` subcommand, and rotating log files manually is done
using the `rotate-log` subcommand, as explained in the following
sections:

* <<To Change the Rotation File Size>>
* <<To Change the File Rotation Interval>>
* <<To Change the Limit Number of Archive Log Files>>
* <<To Rotate Log Files Manually>>

[[to-change-the-rotation-file-size]]

===== To Change the Rotation File Size

Use the `set-log-attributes` subcommand in remote mode to change the log
rotation file size.
The default target of this subcommand is the DAS.
Optionally, you can target a configuration, server, instance, or cluster.

1. Ensure that the DAS is running.

2. Change the rotation file size limit by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#set-log-attributes[`set-log-attributes`] subcommand,
specifying the attribute and the desired limit in megabytes:
+
[source]
----
org.glassfish.main.jul.handler.GlassFishLogHandler.rotation.limit.megabytes=1000

[[to-rotate-log-files-manually]]

===== To Rotate Log Files Manually

You can rotate log files manually by using the `rotate-log` subcommand in remote mode.
The default target of this subcommand is the DAS.
Optionally, you can target a configuration, server, instance, or cluster.
When you use this subcommand, the target log file is immediately moved
to a new time-stamped file and a new log file is created.

Because log rotation is a dynamic operation, you do not need to restart
{productName} for changes to take effect.

1. Ensure that the target server or cluster is running.
2. Rotate log files by using
the xref:reference-manual.adoc#rotate-log[`rotate-log`] subcommand.

[[viewing-log-records]]

=== Viewing Log Records

The recommended means for general viewing of logging information is to
use the Log Viewer in the Administration Console.
The Log Viewer simplifies reading, searching, and filtering log file contents.
For instructions, see the Administration Console online help.

{productName} also allows you to collect log
files into a ZIP archive, which provides the means to obtain and view
log files for an instance or cluster even when it is not currently running.
The following section explains how to collect all available log
files for an instance or cluster and compile them into a single ZIP archive,
which is done by using the `collect-log-files` subcommand.

[[to-collect-log-files-into-a-zip-archive]]

==== To Collect Log Files into a ZIP Archive

Use the `collect-log-files` subcommand in remote mode to collect log
files into a ZIP archive. The default target of this subcommand is the DAS.
Optionally you can target a configuration, server, instance, or cluster.

1. Ensure that the target server or cluster is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Use the xref:reference-manual.adoc#collect-log-files[`collect-log-files`] subcommand
to create the ZIP archive.
+
The default location in which the ZIP archive is created is the
domain-dir``/collected-logs`` directory.
The `collect-log-files` subcommand allows you to specify a nondefault directory
in which the ZIP archive is to be created by using the `--retrieve` option set to `true`,
followed by the directory name.
+
The name of the ZIP file contains the timestamp, as follows:
+
``log_yyyy-mm-dd_hh-min-sec.zip``

[[example-7-16]]
Example 7-16 Collecting and Downloading Log Files as a ZIP File

[[to-list-loggers]]

==== To List Loggers

Use the `list-loggers` subcommand in remote mode to list the logger
name, subsystem, and description of subsystem loggers in your distribution of
{productName}. Class name based loggers are not listed.

1. Ensure that the DAS is running. Remote commands require a running server.
2. List loggers by using
the xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-loggers[`list-loggers`] subcommand.

You can also view the full syntax and options of the subcommand by
typing `asadmin help list-loggers` at the command line.

As an alternative you can take a look into the `default-logging.properties` file
which should contain all useful basic loggers set to a default level. The same
cofiguration is distributed in the new domain1's `logging.properties` file, so
you can print all actual logger names and levels as we described in <<To List Logger Levels>>.
