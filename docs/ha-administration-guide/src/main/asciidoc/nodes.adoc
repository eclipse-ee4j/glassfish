== 3 Administering {productName} Nodes

A node represents a host on which the {productName} software is
installed. A node must exist for every host on which {productName}
instances reside. A node's configuration contains information about the
host such as the name of the host and the location where the {productName} is installed on the host.

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#creating-listing-testing-and-deleting-ssh-nodes[Creating, Listing, Testing, and Deleting `SSH` Nodes]

[[types-of-glassfish-server-nodes]]

=== Types of {productName} Nodes

Each {productName} node is one of the following types of node:

`SSH`::
  An `SSH` node supports communication over secure shell (SSH). If SSH
  is set up and you plan to administer your {productName} instances
  centrally, the instances must reside on `SSH` nodes. +
  An `SSH` node's configuration contains the information that is
  required to connect to the host through SSH. This information
  includes, for example, the user name of the SSH user and the port
  number for SSH connections to the host.
`CONFIG`::
  A `CONFIG` node does not support remote communication. If SSH is not set up
  and you plan to administer your instances locally,
  the instances can reside on `CONFIG` nodes. You cannot use `CONFIG`
  nodes for instances that you plan to administer centrally. +
  Each domain contains a predefined `CONFIG` node that is named
  ``localhost-``domain, where domain is the name of the domain. On the
  host where the domain administration server (DAS) is running, this
  node represents the local host.

=== Creating, Listing, Testing, and Deleting `SSH` Nodes

An `SSH` node supports communication over SSH. If SSH is set up and you
plan to administer your {productName} instances centrally, the
instances must reside on `SSH` nodes. For information about setting up
SSH, see xref:ssh-setup.adoc#enabling-centralized-administration-of-glassfish-server-instances[Enabling Centralized Administration of
{productName} Instances].


{productName} enables you to create `SSH` nodes for use by instances,
obtain information about `SSH` nodes, test if `SSH` nodes are reachable,
and delete `SSH` nodes that are no longer required.

[[to-create-an-ssh-node]]

==== To Create an `SSH` Node

Use the `create-node-ssh` subcommand in remote mode to create an `SSH`
node.

Before You Begin

Ensure that the SSH user can use SSH to log in to the host that the node
will represent. By default, the `create-node-ssh` subcommand validates
the node's parameters and the SSH connection to the host. If the SSH
user cannot use SSH to log in to the host, the validation fails.

1. Ensure that the DAS is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Run the `create-node-ssh` subcommand.
+
[NOTE]
====
Only the options that are required to complete this task are provided in
this step. For information about all the options for configuring the
node, see the xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-node-ssh[`create-node-ssh`(1)] help page.

If you are using password authentication for the SSH user, you must
specify a password file through the `--passwordfile` option of the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#asadmin[`asadmin`] utility. For more information about SSH user
authentication, see xref:ssh-setup.adoc#setting-up-ssh-user-authentication[Setting Up SSH User
Authentication].

Example 3-1 Creating an `SSH` Node

This example creates the `SSH` node `sj01` to represent the host

Command create-node-ssh executed successfully.
----

[[GSHAG348]]

Troubleshooting

The `create-node-ssh` subcommand might fail to create the node and
report the error `Illegal sftp packet len`. If this error occurs, ensure
that no the startup file on the remote host displays text for
noninteractive shells. Examples of startup files are `.bashrc`,
`.cshrc`, `.login`, and `.profile`.

The SSH session interprets any text message that is displayed during
login as a file-transfer protocol packet. Therefore, any statement in a
startup file that displays text messages corrupts the SSH session,
causing this error.

====
To obtain information about all existing nodes in a domain, use the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-nodes[`list-nodes`] subcommand.

==== To Test if an `SSH` Node is Reachable

Use the `ping-node-ssh` subcommand in remote mode to test if an `SSH`
node is reachable.

Before You Begin

Ensure that SSH is configured on the host where the DAS is running and
on the host that the node represents.

1. Ensure that the DAS is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.

[[to-delete-an-ssh-node]]

==== To Delete an `SSH` Node

Use the `delete-node-ssh` subcommand in remote mode to delete an `SSH`
node.

Deleting a node removes the node from the configuration of the DAS. The
node's directories and files are deleted when the last {productName}
instance that resides on the node is deleted.

Before You Begin

Ensure that no {productName} instances reside on the node that you
are deleting. For information about how to delete an instance, see the
following sections.

=== Creating, Listing, and Deleting `CONFIG` Nodes

A `CONFIG` node does not support remote communication. If SSH is not set up
and you plan to administer your instances locally, the
instances can reside on `CONFIG` nodes. You cannot use `CONFIG` nodes
for instances that you plan to administer centrally.

Use the `create-node-config` command in remote mode to create a `CONFIG` node.

[NOTE]
====
If you create an instance locally on a host for which no nodes are
defined, you can create the instance without creating a node beforehand.
In this situation, {productName} creates a `CONFIG` node for you. The

Before You Begin

Ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

that the node represents.
* The node that you are updating exists.

1. Ensure that the DAS is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.

==== To Change the Type of a Node

The subcommands for updating a node can also be used to change the type
of a node.

Changing the type of a `CONFIG` node enables remote communication for
the node. The type of the node after the change determines the protocol
over which the node is enabled for remote communication:

* An `SSH` node is enabled for communication over SSH.

As part of the process of changing the type of a node, you can also
change other configuration data for the node.

Options of the subcommands for updating a node specify the new values of
the node's configuration data. For most options, if you omit the option,
the existing value is unchanged. However, default values are applied in
the following situations:

* Any of the following options of the `update-node-ssh` subcommand is omitted:

** `--sshport`
** `--sshuser`
** `--sshkeyfile`


[CAUTION]
====
Changing an `SSH` node to a `CONFIG` node disables remote communication for the node.
====


Before You Begin

Ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

* SSH is configured on the host where the DAS is running and on
the host that the node represents.
* The node the type of which you are changing exists.

1. Ensure that the DAS is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.

2. Run the appropriate subcommand for updating a node, depending on the
type of the node after the change.
