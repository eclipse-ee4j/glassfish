Hi,

In the interests of helping each other out and keeping 
our Macintoshes running until someone is hired to replace
Ron Mandel, I have created an alias intended for JavaSoft
employees ONLY.

If you are interested in joining the alias, go to the
Net Admin page, http://usna1.ebay/ngna/index.html, and sign
up for the "javasoft-mac@eng" alias.

If we can't have Ron, maybe we can replace him with 400
of us?  :)

bye,
Annette Wagner
