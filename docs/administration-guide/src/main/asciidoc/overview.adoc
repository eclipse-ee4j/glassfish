== 1 Overview of {productName} Administration

{productName} provides a server for developing
and deploying Java Platform Enterprise Edition (Jakarta EE) applications
and web Java Web Services.

As an administrator of{productName}, your main responsibilities are
to establish a secure {productName} environment and to oversee the
services, resources, and users that participate in that environment.
Your key tasks include configuring resources and services, managing
{productName} at runtime, and fixing problems that are associated
with the server. You might also be involved in installing software,
integrating add-on components, and deploying applications.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<Default Settings and Locations>>
* <<Configuration Tasks>>
* <<Administration Tools>>
* <<Instructions for Administering {productName}>>

[[default-settings-and-locations]]

=== Default Settings and Locations

After installation, you might need to perform some immediate
configuration tasks to make your installation function as intended. If
configuration defaults have been accepted, some features are enabled and
some not. For an overview of initial configuration tasks for {productName} services and resources, see xref:#initial-configuration-tasks[Initial Configuration
Tasks].

In addition, you might want to reset default passwords, change names or
locations of files, and so on. The following tables list the default
administration values.


[NOTE]
====
For the zip bundle of {productName} 7, the default administrator
login is `admin`, with no password, which means that no login is
required.

[[configuration-tasks]]

=== Configuration Tasks

Some configuration tasks must be performed directly after installation
for your {productName} environment to work as intended. For example,
if you are using a database with {productName}, you need to set up
database connectivity right away.

Some configuration situations are ongoing and will require you to make
changes many times during the life of your installation. You can use
either the Administration Console or the `asadmin` utility to modify the
configuration. Changes are automatically applied to the appropriate
configuration file.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<Initial Configuration Tasks>>
* <<How Dotted Names Work for Configuration>>
* <<Configuration Files>>
* <<Impact of Configuration Changes>>

[[initial-configuration-tasks]]

==== Initial Configuration Tasks

This section maps the common configuration tasks to the command-line
procedures in this guide. In some situations, the resource or service is
automatically enabled and your configuration tasks involve adjusting or
changing the default settings to suit your specific needs.

The following resources and services frequently require configuration
immediately after installation:

System Properties::
  See xref:general-administration.adoc#administering-system-properties[Administering System
  Properties].
Domains::
  The initial `domain1` is created during installation. Additional
  configuration tasks might include such tasks as configuring additional
  domains or setting up automatic restart. See
  xref:domains.adoc#administering-domains[Administering Domains].
JVM::
  The initial tasks for configuring the JVM include creating JVM options
  and profilers. See xref:jvm.adoc#administering-the-virtual-machine-for-the-java-platform[Administering the Virtual
  Machine for the Java Platform].
Logging::
  By default, logging is enabled, so basic logging works without
  additional configuration. However, you might want to change log
  levels, property values, or the location of log files. See
  xref:logging.adoc#administering-the-logging-service[Administering the Logging Service].
Monitoring::
  By default, the monitoring service is enabled. However, monitoring for
  the individual modules is not enabled, so your first monitoring task
  is to enable monitoring for the modules that you want to monitor. See
  xref:monitoring.adoc#administering-the-monitoring-service[Administering the Monitoring Service].
Life Cycle Modules::
  See xref:lifecycle-modules.adoc#administering-life-cycle-modules[Administering Life Cycle
  Modules].
Security::
  * System Security. Initial configuration tasks might include setting
  up passwords, audit modules, and certificates. See
  "xref:security-guide.adoc#administering-system-security[Administering System Security]" in {productName} Security Guide.
  * User Security. Initial configuration tasks might include creating
  authentication realms and file users. See
  "xref:security-guide.adoc#administering-user-security[Administering User Security]" in {productName} Security Guide.
  * Message Security. Initial configuration tasks might include
  configuring a Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) provider, enabling
  default and non-default security providers, and configuring message
  protection policies. See "xref:security-guide.adoc#administering-message-security[Administering Message
  Security]" in {productName} Security Guide.
Database Connectivity::
  The initial tasks involved in configuring {productName} to connect
  to the Apache Derby database include creating a Java Database
  Connectivity (JDBC) connection pool, creating a JDBC resource, and
  integrating a JDBC driver. See xref:jdbc.adoc#administering-database-connectivity[Administering
  Database Connectivity].
EIS Connectivity::
  The initial tasks involved in configuring {productName} to connect
  to an enterprise information system (EIS) include creating a connector
  connection pool, creating a connector resource, editing a resource
  adapter configuration, creating a connector security map, creating a
  connector work security map, and creating an administered object (if
  needed). See xref:connectors.adoc#administering-eis-connectivity[Administering EIS
  Connectivity].
Internet Connectivity::
  The initial tasks involved in making deployed web applications
  accessible by internet clients include creating HTTP network listeners
  and virtual servers, and configuring the HTTP listeners for SSL (if
  needed). See xref:http_https.adoc#administering-internet-connectivity[Administering Internet
  Connectivity].
Object Request Broker (ORB)::
  An initial configuration task might involve creating an IIOP listener.
  See xref:orb.adoc#administering-the-object-request-broker-orb[Administering the Object Request Broker (ORB)].
JavaMail Service::
  An initial configuration task might involve creating a JavaMail
  resource. See xref:javamail.adoc#administering-the-javamail-service[Administering the JavaMail
  Service].
Java Message Service (JMS)::
  Initial configuration tasks might include creating a physical
  destination, creating connection factories or destination resources,
  creating a JMS host (if the default JMS host is not adequate),
  adjusting connection pool settings (if needed), and configuring
  resource adapters for JMS. See xref:jms.adoc#administering-the-java-message-service-jms[Administering the
  Java Message Service (JMS)].
JNDI Service::
  An initial configuration task might involve creating a JNDI resource.
  See xref:jndi.adoc#administering-the-java-naming-and-directory-interface-jndi-service[Administering the Java Naming and Directory
  Interface (JNDI) Service].

Information and instructions for accomplishing the tasks by using the
Administration Console are contained in the Administration Console
online help.

[[how-dotted-names-work-for-configuration]]

==== How Dotted Names Work for Configuration

After the initial configuration is working, you will continue to manage
ongoing configuration for the life of your {productName}
installation. You might need to adjust resources to improve
productivity, or issues might arise that require settings to be modified
or defaults to be reset. In some situations, an `asadmin` subcommand is
provided for updating, such as the `update-connector-work-security-map`
subcommand. However, most updating is done by using the `list`, `get`,
and `set` subcommands with dotted names. For detailed information about
dotted names, see the xref:reference-manual.adoc#dotted-names[`dotted-names`(5ASC)] help page.


[NOTE]
====
Dotted names also apply to monitoring, but the method is different. For
information on using dotted names for monitoring, see
xref:monitoring.adoc#how-the-monitoring-tree-structure-works[How the Monitoring Tree Structure Works].
====


The general process for working with configuration changes on the
command line is as follows:

1. List the modules for the component of interest.
+
The following single mode example uses the | (pipe) character and the
`grep` command to narrow the search:
+
[source]
----
asadmin list "*" | grep http | grep listener
----
Information similar to the following is returned:
+
[source]
----
configs.config.server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.http-listener-1
configs.config.server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.http-listener-2
configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.admin-listener.http
configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.admin-listener.http.file-cache
configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.http-listener-1
configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.http-listener-1.http
configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.http-listener-1.http.file-cache
configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.http-listener-2
configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.http-listener-2.http
configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.http-listener-2.http.file-cache
configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.http-listener-2.ssl
----

2. Get the attributes that apply to the module you are interested in.
+
The following multimode example gets the attributes and values for
`http-listener-1`:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> get server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.http-listener-1.*
----
Information similar to the following is returned:
+
[source]
----
server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.acceptor-threads = 1
server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.address = 0.0.0.0
server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.blocking-enabled = false
server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.default-virtual-server = server
server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.enabled = true
server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.external-port =
server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.family = inet
server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.id = http-listener-1
server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.port = 8080
server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.redirect-port =
server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.security-enabled = false
server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.server-name =
server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.xpowered-by = true
----

3. Modify an attribute by using the `set` subcommand.
+
This example sets the `security-enabled` attribute of `http-listener-1`
to true:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> set server.http-service.http-listener.http-listener-1.security-enabled = true
----

[[configuration-files]]

==== Configuration Files

The bulk of the configuration information about {productName}
resources, applications, and instances is stored in the `domain.xml`
configuration file.
This file is the central repository for a given
administrative domain and contains an XML representation of the {productName} domain model.
The default location for the `domain.xml` file is domain-dir``/config``.

[NOTE]
====
{productName} maintains a backup of the `domain.xml` file that is
named `domain.xml.bak`. The purpose of this file is solely to enable
{productName} to start a domain if the `domain.xml` file cannot be
read.
Do not modify or delete the `domain.xml.bak` file and do not use this file for any other purpose.
====

The `logging.properties` file is used to configure the Java Util Logging system.
The default `logging.properties` file is located in the same directory as the `domain.xml` file.
For further information on the `logging.properties` file,
see xref:logging.adoc#logging-properties[Logging Properties].

The `asenv.conf` file is located in the as-install``/config`` directory.
Its purpose is to store the {productName} environment variables, such
as the installation location of the database, Message Queue, and so on.

[NOTE]
====
Changes are automatically applied to the appropriate configuration file.
Do not edit the configuration files directly.
Manual editing is prone to error and can have unexpected results.
====


[[impact-of-configuration-changes]]

==== Impact of Configuration Changes

Some configuration changes require that you restart the DAS or {productName} instances for the changes to take effect. Other changes are
applied dynamically without requiring that the DAS or instances be restarted.
The procedures in this guide indicate when a restart is required.
{productName} enables you to determine whether the DAS or
an instance must be restarted to apply configuration changes.

Some changes to resources or connection pools affect the applications
that use the resources or connection pools. These changes do not require restart.
However, any applications that use the resources or connection
pools must be disabled and re-enabled or redeployed for the change to take effect.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<To Determine Whether the DAS or an Instance Requires Restart>>
* <<Configuration Changes That Require Restart>>
* <<Dynamic Configuration Changes>>
* <<Changes That Affect Applications>>

[[to-determine-whether-the-das-or-an-instance-requires-restart]]

===== To Determine Whether the DAS or an Instance Requires Restart

1. Ensure that the DAS is running.
To obtain information about the DAS or an instance, a running server is required.

2. Do one of the following:
* To determine if the DAS requires restart, list the domains in your {productName} installation.
Use the xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-domains[`list-domains`] subcommand for this purpose.
+
[source]
----
asadmin> list-domains [--domaindir domain-root-dir]
----
+
The domain-root-dir is the directory that contains the directories in
which individual domains' configuration is stored.
The default is as-install``/domains``, where as-install is the base installation
directory of the {productName} software.
If the DAS requires restart, a statement that restart is required is displayed.

* To determine if an instance requires restart, list information about the instance.
Use the xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-instances[`list-instances`] subcommand for this purpose.
+
[source]
----
asadmin> list-instances instance-name
----
The instance-name is the name of the instance for which you are listing
information.
If the instance requires restart, one of the following pieces of
information is displayed: a statement that restart is required,
or a list of configuration changes that are not yet applied to the instance.

[[gkvay]]
Example 1-1 Determining if the DAS Requires Restart

This example determines that the DAS for the domain `domain1` requires
restart to apply configuration changes.

[source]
----
asadmin> list-domains
domain1 running, restart required to apply configuration changes
Command list-domains executed successfully.
----

[[gkvba]]
Example 1-2 Determining if an Instance Requires Restart

This example determines that the instance `pmd-i1` requires restart to
apply configuration changes.

[source]
----
asadmin> list-instances pmd-i1
pmd-i1   running;  requires restart
Command list-instances executed successfully.
----

See Also

* xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-domains[`list-domains`(1)]
* xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-instances[`list-instances`(1)]

You can also view the full syntax and options of the subcommands by
typing the following commands at the command line.

* `asadmin help list-domains`
* `asadmin help list-instances`

[[configuration-changes-that-require-restart]]

===== Configuration Changes That Require Restart

The following configuration changes require restart for the changes to
take effect:

* Changing JVM options
* Changing port numbers
+

[NOTE]
====
Changes to some port numbers, for example HTTP listener ports, do not
require restart.
====

* Changing log handler elements
* Configuring certificates
* Managing HTTP, JMS, IIOP, JNDI services
* Enabling or disabling secure administration as explained in
"xref:security-guide.adoc#running-secure-admin[Running Secure Admin]" in {productName} Security Guide

[[dynamic-configuration-changes]]

===== Dynamic Configuration Changes

With dynamic configuration, changes take effect while the DAS or
instance is running. The following configuration changes do not require
restart:

* Adding or deleting add-on components
* Adding or removing JDBC, JMS, and connector resources and pools
(Exception: Some connection pool properties affect applications.)
* Changing a system property that is not referenced by a JVM option or a
port
* Adding file realm users
* Changing logging levels
* Enabling and disabling monitoring
* Changing monitoring levels for modules
* Enabling and disabling resources and applications
* Deploying, undeploying, and redeploying applications

[[changes-that-affect-applications]]

===== Changes That Affect Applications

Some changes to resources or connection pools affect the applications
that use the resources or connection pools. These changes do not require
restart. However, any applications that use the resources or connection
pools must be disabled and re-enabled or redeployed for the change to
take effect.


[NOTE]
====
If you do not know which applications use the changed resources or
connection pools, you can apply these changes by restarting the clusters
or{productName} instances to which applications are deployed.
However, to minimize the disruption to the services that your
applications provide, avoid restarting clusters or instances to apply
these changes if possible.
====


The following changes affect applications:

* Creating or deleting resources (Exception: Changes to some JDBC, JMS,
or connector resources do not affect applications.)
* Modifying the following JDBC connection pool properties:

** `datasource-classname`

** `associate-with-thread`

** `lazy-connection-association`

** `lazy-connection-enlistment`

** JDBC driver vendor-specific properties
* Modifying the following connector connection pool properties:

** `resource-adapter-name`

** `connection-definition-name`

** `transaction-support`

** `associate-with-thread`

** `lazy-connection-association`

** `lazy-connection-enlistment`

** Vendor-specific properties

[[administration-tools]]

=== Administration Tools

For the most part, you can perform the same tasks by using either the
graphical Administration Console or the `asadmin` command-line utility,
however, there are exceptions.

The following {productName} administration tools are described here:

* <<Administration Console>>
* <<`asadmin` Utility>>
* <<REST Interfaces>>
* <<OSGi Module Management Subsystem>>
* <<`keytool` Utility>>
* <<Java Monitoring and Management Console (JConsole)>>

[[administration-console]]

==== Administration Console

The Administration Console is a browser-based utility that features an
easy-to-navigate graphical interface that includes extensive online help
for the administrative tasks.

To use the Administration Console, the domain administration server
(DAS) must be running. Each domain has its own DAS, which has a unique
port number. When {productName} was installed, you chose a port
number for the DAS, or used the default port of 4848. You also specified
a user name and password if you did not accept the default login
(`admin` with no password).

When specifying the URL for the Administration Console, use the port
number for the domain to be administered. The format for starting the
Administration Console in a web browser is `http://`hostname`:`port. For
example:

[source]
----
http://kindness.example.com:4848
----

If the Administration Console is running on the host where {productName} was installed, specify `localhost` for the host name. For
example:

[source]
----
http://localhost:4848
----

If the Administration Console is run on a host different from the host
where {productName} was installed, a secure connection (`https`
instead of `http`) is used. Some browsers do not display pages on secure
connections by default and must be configured to permit secure protocols
(SSL and TLS).

For Microsoft Windows, an alternate way to start the {productName}
Administration Console is by using the Start menu.

You can display the help material for a page in the Administration
Console by clicking the Help button on the page. The initial help page
describes the functions and fields of the page itself. Associated task
instructions can be accessed on additional pages by clicking a link in
the See Also list.


[NOTE]
====
If you try to use the Administration Console from a system through a
proxy server on another system back to the original system, while using
the system's full host name (instead of `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`) you
are denied access because the request is treated as a remote request,
which requires that the secure administration feature (secure admin) be
enabled.

To avoid this situation, do one of the following:

* Do not use a proxy server.
* Use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as the host name.
* Enable secure admin so that what {productName} interprets as a
remote request is accepted as such.

To enable secure admin, see "xref:security-guide.adoc#managing-administrative-security[Managing Administrative
Security]" in {productName} Security Guide.
====


[[asadmin-utility]]

==== `asadmin` Utility

The `asadmin` utility is a command-line tool that runs subcommands for
identifying the operation or task that you want to perform. You can run
`asadmin` subcommands either from a command prompt or from a script.
Running `asadmin` subcommands from a script is helpful for automating
repetitive tasks. Basic information about how the `asadmin` utility
works can be found in the xref:reference-manual.adoc#asadmin[`asadmin`(1M)] help page. For
instructions on using the `asadmin` utility, see
xref:general-administration.adoc#using-the-asadmin-utility[Using the `asadmin` Utility].

To issue an `asadmin` subcommand in the standard command shell (single
mode), go to the as-install``/bin`` directory and type the `asadmin`
command followed by a subcommand. For example:

[source]
----
asadmin list-jdbc-resources
----

You can invoke multiple command mode (multimode) by typing `asadmin` at
the command prompt, after which the `asadmin>` prompt is presented. The
`asadmin` utility continues to accept subcommands until you exit
multimode and return to the standard command shell. For example:

[source]
----
asadmin> list-jdbc-resources
----

You can display a help page for any `asadmin` subcommand by typing
`help` before the subcommand name. For example:

[source]
----
asadmin> help restart-domain
----

or

[source]
----
asadmin help restart-domain
----

A collection of the `asadmin` help pages is available in HTML and PDF
format in the xref:reference-manual.adoc#GSRFM[{productName} Reference
Manual].

[[rest-interfaces]]

==== REST Interfaces

{productName} provides representational state transfer (REST)
interfaces to enable you to access monitoring and configuration data for
{productName}, including data that is provided by newly installed
add-on components. For more information, see
xref:general-administration.adoc#using-rest-interfaces-to-administer-glassfish-server[Using REST Interfaces to
Administer {productName}].

[[osgi-module-management-subsystem]]

==== OSGi Module Management Subsystem

The OSGi module management subsystem that is provided with {productName} is the http://felix.apache.org/[Apache Felix OSGi framework] . To
administer this framework, use the either of the following tools:

* http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-remote-shell.html[Apache
Felix Gogo] remote shell. This shell is provided with {productName}.
The shell uses the Felix Gogo shell service to interact with the OSGi
module management subsystem.
* GlassFish OSGi Administration Console. This console is distributed as
an add-on component for {productName} or as a set of files from the
Maven GlassFish repository. In both distributions, the GlassFish OSGi
Web Console is provided as an extension to the Administration Console
and as a standalone web application. The GlassFish OSGi Administration
Console is a customized version of the
http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-web-console.html[Apache
Felix Web Console].

These tools enable you to perform administrative tasks on OSGi bundles
such as:

* Browsing installed OSGi bundles
* Viewing the headers of installed OSGi bundles
* Installing OSGi bundles
* Controlling the life cycle of installed bundles

[[to-enable-the-apache-felix-gogo-remote-shell]]

===== To Enable the Apache Felix Gogo Remote Shell

By default, the Apache Felix Gogo remote shell in {productName} is
disabled. Before using the shell to administer OSGi bundles in {productName}, you must enable the shell.

Enabling the Apache Felix Gogo remote shell in {productName} involves
changing the value of the property `glassfish.osgi.start.level.final`.
This property controls whether the OSGi start level service enables the
shell when the DAS or a {productName} instance is started.

1. Ensure that the DAS is running.
+
[[CEGDBDBH]]
2. Change the value of the `glassfish.osgi.start.level.final` property from 2 to 3.
If the domain includes clustered or standalone instances on remote
hosts, perform this step on each remote host. You can change this value either by creating a Java system property or
by editing a file.
* To change this value by creating a Java system property, create the
Java system property `glassfish.osgi.start.level.final` with a value of 3.
+
[source]
----
asadmin> create-jvm-options --target target -Dglassfish.osgi.start.level.final=3
----
target::
  The target for which you are creating the property.
+
  For the DAS, the target is `server`.
+
  For a clustered or standalone instance, the target is the name of the
  instance.
* To change this value by editing a file, edit the plain-text file
as-install``/config/osgi.properties`` to change the value of the
`glassfish.osgi.start.level.final` property from 2 to 3.

3. Restart the DAS.
For instructions, see xref:domains.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart a Domain].

[[to-run-apache-felix-gogo-remote-shell-commands]]

===== To Run Apache Felix Gogo Remote Shell Commands

The Apache Felix Gogo remote shell is integrated with the {productName} `asadmin` command line utility. You can use the `asadmin`
subcommands `osgi` and `osgi-shell` to access the remote shell and run
OSGi shell commands.

[[GSADG1051]]

To Run Remote Shell Commands Using the `osgi` Subcommand

The `osgi` subcommand delegates the command line to the Apache Felix
Gogo remote shell for the execution of OSGi shell commands. Commands are
executed by the remote shell and results are returned by the `asadmin`
utility. The `osgi` subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

1. Ensure that the server is running.
Remote commands require a running server.
2. Access the remote shell by using the xref:reference-manual.adoc#redeploy[`osgi`]
subcommand. For the full syntax and options for this subcommand, see `osgi`(1).

[[GSADG1052]]

To Run Remote Shell Commands Using the `osgi-shell` Subcommand

The `osgi-shell` subcommand provides interactive access to the Apache
Felix Gogo remote shell for the execution of OSGi shell commands. OSGi
shell commands are executed on the server and results are printed on the client.
You can run multiple commands from a file or run commands interactively.
The `osgi-shell` subcommand is supported in local mode only.
Unlike other local subcommands, however, the DAS and the server
instance whose shell is being accessed must be running.

1. Ensure that the server is running.
2. Access the remote shell by using the xref:reference-manual.adoc#redeploy[`osgi-shell`]
subcommand. For the full syntax and options for this subcommand, see `osgi-shell`(1).
