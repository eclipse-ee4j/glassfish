Description

The `enable-secure-admin` subcommand causes the DAS and the instances in
the domain to use SSL certificates for encrypting the messages they send
to each other. This subcommand also allows the DAS to accept
administration messages from remote admin clients such as the asadmin
utility and IDEs.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

You must restart any running servers in the domain after you enable or
disable secure admin. It is simpler to enable or disable secure admin
with only the DAS running, then restart the DAS, and then start any
other instances.

=======================================================================


By default, when secure admin is enabled the DAS and the instances use
these SSL certificates to authenticate to each other as security
"principals" and to authorize admin access. The `--asadminalias` value
indicates to the DAS which SSL certificate it should use to identify
itself to the instances. The `--instancealias` value determines for
instances which SSL certificate they should use to identify themselves
to the DAS.

The `enable-secure-admin` subcommand fails if any administrative user in
the domain has a blank password.

Alternatively, you can use the `enable-secure-admin-internal-user`
subcommand to cause the servers to identify themselves using a secure
admin user name and password.
