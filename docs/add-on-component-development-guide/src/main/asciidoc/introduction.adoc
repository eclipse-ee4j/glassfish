== Introduction to the Development Environment for {productName} Add-On Components

{productName} enables an external vendor such as
an independent software vendor (ISV), original equipment manufacturer
(OEM), or system integrator to incorporate {productName} into a new
product with the vendor's own brand name. External vendors can extend
the functionality of {productName} by developing add-on components
for {productName}. {productName} provides interfaces to enable
add-on components to be configured, managed, and monitored through
existing {productName} tools such as the Administration Console and
the `asadmin` utility.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<{productName} Modular Architecture and Add-On Components>>
* <<OSGi Alliance Module Management Subsystem>>
* <<Hundred-Kilobyte Kernel>>
* <<Overview of the Development Process for an Add-On Component>>

=== {productName} Modular Architecture and Add-On Components

{productName} has a modular architecture in which the features of
{productName} are provided by a consistent set of components that
interact with each other. Each component provides a small set of
functionally related features.

The modular architecture of {productName} enables users to download
and install only the components that are required for the applications
that are being deployed. As a result, start-up times, memory
consumption, and disk space requirements are all minimized.

The modular architecture of {productName} enables you to extend the
basic functionality of {productName} by developing add-on components.
An add-on component is an encapsulated definition of reusable code that
has the following characteristics:

* The component provides a set of Java classes.
* The component offers services and public interfaces.
* The component implements the public interfaces with a set of private classes.
* The component depends on other components.

Add-on components that you develop interact with {productName} in the
same way as components that are supplied in {productName}
distributions.

You can create and offer new or updated add-on components at any time.
{productName} administrators can install add-on components and update
or remove installed components after {productName} is installed. For
more information, see "xref:administration-guide.adoc#GSADG00014[Extending and Updating {productName}]" in {productName} Administration Guide.

[[osgi-alliance-module-management-subsystem]]

=== OSGi Alliance Module Management Subsystem

To enable components to be added when required, {productName}
provides a lightweight and extensible kernel that uses the module
management subsystem from the http://www.osgi.org/[OSGi Alliance]
(`http://www.osgi.org/`). Any {productName} component that plugs in
to this kernel must be implemented as an OSGi bundle. To enable an
add-on component to plug in to the {productName} kernel in the same
way as other components, package the component as an OSGi bundle. For
more information, see
xref:packaging-integrating-delivering.adoc#packaging-an-add-on-component[Packaging an Add-On
Component].

The default OSGi module management subsystem in {productName} is the
Apache Felix http://felix.apache.org[OSGi framework]
(`http://felix.apache.org`). However, the {productName} kernel uses
only the http://www.osgi.org/Release4/HomePage[OSGi Service Platform
Release 4] (`http://www.osgi.org/Release4/HomePage`) API. Therefore,
{productName} supports other OSGi module management subsystems that
are compatible with the OSGi Service Platform Release 4 API.

[[hundred-kilobyte-kernel]]

=== Hundred-Kilobyte Kernel

The https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish-hk2[Hundred-Kilobyte Kernel (HK2)]
(`https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish-hk2`) is the lightweight and extensible kernel
of {productName}. HK2 consists of the following technologies:

* Module subsystem. The HK2 module subsystem provides isolation between
components of the {productName}. The HK2 module subsystem is
compatible with existing technologies such as the OSGi framework.
* Component model. The HK2 component model eases the development of
components that are also services. {productName} discovers these
components automatically and dynamically. HK2 components use injection
of dependencies to express dependencies on other components. {productName} provides two-way mappings between the services of an HK2
component and OSGi services.

For more information, see xref:writing-hk2-components.adoc#writing-hk2-components[Writing
HK2 Components].

[[overview-of-the-development-process-for-an-add-on-component]]

=== Overview of the Development Process for an Add-On Component

To ensure that an add-on component behaves identically to components
that are supplied in {productName} distributions, the component must
meet the following requirements:

* If the component generates management data, configuration data, or
monitoring data, it must provide that data to other {productName}
components in the same way as other {productName} components.
* If the component generates management data, configuration data, or
monitoring data, it must provide that data to users through {productName} administrative interfaces such as Administration Console and the
`asadmin` utility.
* The component must be packaged and delivered as an OSGi bundle.

To develop add-on components that meet these requirements, follow the
development process that is described in the following sections:

* <<Writing HK2 Components>>
* <<Extending the Administration Console]
* <<Extending the `asadmin` Utility]
* <<Adding Monitoring Capabilities>>
* <<Adding Configuration Data for a Component>>
* <<Adding Container Capabilities>>
* <<Creating a Session Persistence Module>>
* <<Packaging and Delivering an Add-On Component>>

==== Writing HK2 Components

The Hundred-Kilobyte Kernel (HK2) is the lightweight and extensible
kernel of {productName}. To interact with {productName}, add-on
components plug in to this kernel. In the HK2 component model, the
functions of an add-on component are declared through a contract-service
implementation paradigm. An HK2 contract identifies and describes the
building blocks or the extension points of an application. An HK2
service implements an HK2 contract.

For more information, see xref:writing-hk2-components.adoc#writing-hk2-components[Writing
HK2 Components].

==== Extending the Administration Console

The Administration Console is a browser-based tool for administering
{productName}. It features an easy-to-navigate interface and online
help. Extending the Administration Console enables you to provide a
graphical user interface for administering your add-on component. You
can use any of the user interface features of the Administration
Console, such as tree nodes, links on the Common Tasks page, tabs and
sub-tabs, property sheets, and JavaServer Faces pages. Your add-on
component implements a marker interface and provides a configuration
file that describes how your customizations integrate with the
Administration Console.

For more information, see
xref:extending-the-admin-console.adoc#extending-the-administration-console[Extending the Administration
Console].

==== Extending the `asadmin` Utility

The `asadmin` utility is a command-line tool for configuring and
administering {productName}. Extending the `asadmin` utility enables
you to provide administrative interfaces for an add-on component that
are consistent with the interfaces of other {productName} components.
A user can run `asadmin` subcommands either from a command prompt or
from a script. For more information about the `asadmin` utility, see the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#asadmin[`asadmin`(1M)] man page.

For more information, see xref:extending-asadmin.adoc#extending-the-asadmin-utility[Extending the
`asadmin` Utility].

==== Adding Monitoring Capabilities

Monitoring is the process of reviewing the statistics of a system to
improve performance or solve problems. By monitoring the state of
components and services that are deployed in the {productName},
system administrators can identify performance bottlenecks, predict
failures, perform root cause analysis, and ensure that everything is
functioning as expected. Monitoring data can also be useful in
performance tuning and capacity planning.

An add-on component typically generates statistics that the {productName} can gather at run time. Adding monitoring capabilities enables an
add-on component to provide statistics to {productName} in the same
way as components that are supplied in {productName} distributions.
As a result, system administrators can use the same administrative
interfaces to monitor statistics from any installed {productName}
component, regardless of the origin of the component.

For more information, see
xref:adding-monitoring-capabilities.adoc#adding-monitoring-capabilities[Adding Monitoring Capabilities].

==== Adding Configuration Data for a Component

The configuration data of a component determines the characteristics and
runtime behavior of a component. {productName} provides interfaces to
enable an add-on component to store its configuration data in the same
way as other {productName} components. These interfaces are similar
to interfaces that are defined in
https://jakarta.ee/specifications/xml-binding/3.0/[Jakarta XML Binding 3.0]
(`https://jakarta.ee/specifications/xml-binding/3.0/`). By using these interfaces to
store configuration data, you ensure that the add-on component is fully
integrated with {productName}. As a result, administrators can
configure an add-on component in the same way as they can configure
other {productName} components.

For more information, see
xref:adding-configuration-data.adoc#adding-configuration-data-for-a-component[
Adding Configuration Data for a Component].

==== Adding Container Capabilities

Applications run on {productName} in containers. {productName}
enables you to create containers that extend or replace the existing
containers of {productName}. Adding container capabilities enables
you to run new types of applications and to deploy new archive types in
{productName}.

For more information, see
xref:adding-container-capabilities.adoc#adding-container-capabilities[Adding Container Capabilities].

==== Creating a Session Persistence Module

{productName} enables you to create a session persistence module in
the web container for high availability-related functionality by
implementing the `PersistenceStrategyBuilder` interface . Using the
`PersistenceStrategyBuilder` interface in an HK2 service makes the
session manager extensible because you can implement a new persistence
type without having to modify the web container code.

For information about other high-availability, session persistence
solutions, see "xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#configuring-high-availability-session-persistence-and-failover[Configuring High Availability Session
Persistence and Failover]" in {productName} High
Availability Administration Guide.

For more information, see
xref:session-persistence-modules.adoc#creating-a-session-persistence-module[Creating a Session
Persistence Module].

==== Packaging and Delivering an Add-On Component

Packaging an add-on component enables the component to interact with the
{productName} kernel in the same way as other components. Integrating
a component with {productName} enables {productName} to discover
the component at runtime. If an add-on component is an extension or
update to existing installations of {productName}, deliver the
component through Update Tool.

For more information, see
xref:packaging-integrating-delivering.adoc#packaging-integrating-and-delivering-an-add-on-component[Packaging, Integrating,
and Delivering an Add-On Component].
