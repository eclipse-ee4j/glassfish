== 4 Administering the Virtual Machine for the Java Platform

This chapter provides procedures for administering the Virtual Machine
for the Java platform (Java Virtual Machine) or JVM machine) in the
{productName} 7 environment by using the
`asadmin` command-line utility.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<Administering JVM Options>>
* <<Administering the Profiler>>

Instructions for accomplishing these tasks by using the Administration
Console are contained in the Administration Console online help.

=== Administering JVM Options

The Java Virtual Machine is an interpretive computing engine responsible
for running the byte codes in a compiled Java program. The virtual
machine translates the Java byte codes into the native instructions of
the host machine. {productName}, being a Java process, requires a
virtual machine to run and support the Java applications running on it.
JVM settings are part of an {productName} configuration.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<To Create JVM Options>>
* <<To List JVM Options>>
* <<To Delete JVM Options>>
* <<To Generate a JVM Report>>

[[to-create-jvm-options]]

==== To Create JVM Options

Use the `create-jvm-options` subcommand in remote mode to create JVM
options in the Java configuration or the profiler elements of the
`domain.xml` file. If JVM options are created for a profiler, these
options are used to record the settings that initiate the profiler.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Create JVM options by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-jvm-options[`create-jvm-options`] subcommand.
+
To create more than one JVM option, use a colon (:) to separate the
options. If the JVM option itself contains a colon (:), use the
backslash (\) to offset the colon delimiter.
+
Information about properties for the subcommand is included in this help
page.
3. To apply your changes, restart {productName}. See
xref:domains.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart a Domain].

You can also view the full syntax and options of the subcommand by
typing `asadmin help create-jvm-options` at the command line.

[[to-list-jvm-options]]

==== To List JVM Options

Use the `list-jvm-options` subcommand in remote mode to list the
existing JVM options.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. List JVM options by using the xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-jvm-options[`list-jvm-options`]
subcommand.

[[to-delete-jvm-options]]

==== To Delete JVM Options

Use the `delete-jvm-options` subcommand in remote mode to delete JVM
options from the Java configuration or profiler elements of the
`domain.xml` file.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. List JVM options by using the xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-jvm-options[`list-jvm-options`]
subcommand.
3. If necessary, notify users that the JVM option is being deleted.
4. Delete JVM options by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#delete-jvm-options[`delete-jvm-options`] subcommand.
+
To remove more than one JVM option, use a colon (:) to separate the
options. If the JVM option itself contains a colon, use the backslash
(\) to offset the colon delimiter.
5. To apply your changes, restart {productName}. See
xref:domains.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart a Domain].

You can also view the full syntax and options of the subcommand by
typing `asadmin help delete-jvm-options` at the command line.

[[to-generate-a-jvm-report]]

==== To Generate a JVM Report

Use the `generate-jvm-report` subcommand in remote mode to generate a
JVM report showing the threads (dump of a stack trace), classes, memory,
and loggers for a specified instance, including the domain
administration server (DAS). You can generate the following types of
reports: summary (default), class, thread, log.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Generate the report by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#generate-jvm-report[`generate-jvm-report`] subcommand.

[[administering-the-profiler]]

=== Administering the Profiler

A profiler generates information used to analyze server performance.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<To Create a Profiler>>
* <<To Delete a Profiler>>

[[to-create-a-profiler]]

==== To Create a Profiler

A server instance is tied to a particular profiler by the profiler
element in the Java configuration. If JVM options are created for a
profiler, the options are used to record the settings needed to activate
a particular profiler. Use the `create-profiler` subcommand in remote
mode to create the profiler element in the Java configuration.

Only one profiler can exist. If a profiler already exists, you receive
an error message that directs you to delete the existing profiler before
creating a new one.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Create a profiler by using the xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-profiler[`create-profiler`]
subcommand.
+
Information about properties for the subcommand is included in this help
page.
3. To apply your changes, restart {productName}.
+
See xref:domains.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart a Domain].

You can also view the full syntax and options of the subcommand by
typing `asadmin help create-profiler` at the command line.

[[to-delete-a-profiler]]

==== To Delete a Profiler

Use the `delete-profiler` subcommand in remote mode to delete the
profiler element from the Java configuration. You can then create a new
profiler.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Delete the profiler by using the xref:reference-manual.adoc#delete-profiler[`delete-profiler`]
subcommand.
3. To apply your changes, restart {productName}.
