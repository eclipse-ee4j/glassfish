[[identifying-the-problem]]

=== Identifying the Problem

Application servers are typically deployed in complex operating
environments and involve many technologies, products, and tools.
Understanding and diagnosing problems in enterprise software with many
components performing many tasks can be a challenge. This section
describes how to get started , and contains the following topics:

* xref:#first-steps[First Steps]
* xref:#gathering-information[Gathering Information]
* xref:#examining-log-files[Examining Log Files]
* xref:#monitoring-the-system[Monitoring the System]

[[first-steps]]

==== First Steps

Sometimes the most obvious solutions are overlooked. As you begin your
investigation, try the following steps first.

[[verify-system-requirements-and-configuration]]

===== Verify System Requirements and Configuration

Ensure that your system meets the requirements listed in
"xref:release-notes.adoc#hardware-and-software-requirements[Hardware and Software Requirements]"
in {productName} Release Notes.
Problems are likely to arise if you attempt to install on a platform that
is not supported or on a system that in some other way does not meet release requirements.
Also see "xref:release-notes.adoc#GSRLN00253[Known Issues]"
in {productName} Release Notes for known issues related to installation.

{productName} requires JDK release 11 or newer.
If necessary, download and install the required JDK software.

On Solaris, Linux, and Windows systems, JDK software is available from the
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[
Java SE downloads page]
(`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html`).

For Mac OS X systems, {productName} uses the JDK
that is part of the Macintosh operating system. If necessary, obtain the
required JDK version from the http://support.apple.com/downloads/[Mac OS
X Updates site] (`http://support.apple.com/downloads/`).

Also ensure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable on your system
points to the JDK installation directory and not the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) software.

Set `JAVA_HOME` and `$JAVA_HOME/bin` in the `PATH` to point to the
supported JDK version.

[[review-known-issues]]

===== Review Known Issues

Your problem might be related to a known issue for the release. Refer to
the xref:release-notes.adoc#GSRLN[{productName} Release Notes] for
the latest information regarding known issues and possible workarounds.
Also search the GlassFish issues at
`https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues`.

[[search-the-product-documentation]]

===== Search the Product Documentation

{productName} includes complete product
documentation. Search the documentation to see if your problem is
addressed. See xref:preface.adoc#glassfish-server-documentation-set[{productName} Documentation Set]
for the books in the documentation set and a description of their contents.
Also see the Administration Console online help for detailed
information about performing administrative tasks using the graphical interface.

The following books will be especially helpful for troubleshooting:

* xref:release-notes.adoc#GSRLN[{productName} Release Notes],
  which provides the latest information regarding known issues and possible workarounds.
* xref:error-messages-reference.adoc#GSEMR[
  {productName} Error Message Reference],
  which lists error messages you might encounter when using {productName}.

Use the product documentation to learn more about {productName}. The more you know about the product the easier it might
be to figure out why something isn't working.

[[search-the-glassfish-mailing-lists-and-forums]]

===== Search the GlassFish Mailing Lists and Forums

Lists and forums are extremely helpful resources, and are accessed as follows:

* GlassFish mailing lists: `https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/glassfish-dev`
* GlassFish user forum: `https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/f/419/`

[[gathering-information]]

==== Gathering Information

Troubleshooting and analysis require information. The more information
you have the easier it is to classify a problem and search for its
solution. Detailed information will also be necessary should you need to
contact others for support, either through a community mailing list or
through more formal Sun support channels.

As you continue your investigation, consider the following questions.

[[when-does-the-problem-occur]]

===== When Does the Problem Occur?

* What do the logs show? What kind of error message are you getting? For
more information about logs, see xref:#examining-log-files[Examining Log Files]. Logs
are a good place to start your troubleshooting.
* What are you trying to do when the problem occurs and how are you
doing it? What is the sequence of events?
* Does the problem occur every time you perform the same type of
operation, or does it seem random? Can you reproduce the issue?
* Have other events or problems occurred that could possibly be related,
such as web sessions closing early, exceptions being thrown in your own
application logic, components not being correctly deployed or
undeployed?

[[what-is-your-environment]]

===== What Is Your Environment?

* What version of {productName} are you using?
What operating system and version? What JDK version? Many problems are
caused simply because system requirements for the release are not met.
Refer to the xref:release-notes.adoc#GSRLN[{productName} Release
Notes] for the latest information regarding system requirements, and
make sure your system meets those requirements.
* What resources does your system have, such as memory, disk, and swap
space? If system memory is an issue, look for ways to optimize your
configuration and consider taking other actions such as adding memory or
decreasing system load.
* Have any patches been applied? If so, what are the product and
operating system patch numbers?
* What other products and technologies are installed and being used in
the installation?
* How many application servers, web servers, and directory servers are
installed? What are the products and versions?
* How is the web server connected to {productName}? On the same system?
* How is {productName} connected to the directory
server?
* What JDBC driver is being used to access the database?

[[what-is-your-system-configuration]]

===== What Is Your System Configuration?

* What are your settings?
* On which port is {productName} configured — the
default or something else?
* What defaults were changed during installation and what are the
values?
* What other settings were changed from the defaults and what are their
values?
* What are the parameters related to JVM heap, stack, and garbage
collection set to?
* What are the JVM options?
* What is the permgen size? `OutOfMemoryError:PermGen space` errors are
common and indicate that you need to increase the permanent generation
space available.
* Is SSL enabled?
* What are your network settings (proxy, firewall, and so on)? What
happens if you disable your firewall and attempt the task?

[[what-is-different]]

===== What Is Different?

* What is different that could have provoked the problem or triggered
the event? Was something new added or changed? Have any new applications
been deployed? If changes have been made recently, consider backing them
out and seeing what happens — does the problem still occur?
* Was the feature or functionality working correctly at one time? If so,
what changed or happened between then and now?
* Is this working on another system? If so, what is different about that
environment?

[[examining-log-files]]

==== Examining Log Files

Logging is one of your most important troubleshooting tools. It is the
process by which {productName} captures data
about events that occur during server operation, such as configuration
errors, security failures, or server malfunction. This data is recorded
in log files, and is usually your first source of information when
Enterprise Server problems occur. The primary purpose of log files is to
provide troubleshooting information. Analyzing the log files can help
determine the health of the server and identify problem areas.

By default, log information for each {productName} server instance is captured in a `server.log` file. That is,
each instance, including the domain administration server (DAS), has an
individual log file. By default, the log file for the DAS is located in
domain-dir``/logs``, and the log file for each instance is located in
instance-dir``/logs`.

In addition, for domains that use clustering, {productName} captures log information for each cluster instance in a
`cluster.log` file. By default, the `cluster.log` file is also located
in instance-dir``/logs``.

Oracle recommends using the Administration Console to view logging
information. However, you can open a log file in a text editor and
search for the module or message in which you are interested. {productName} also lets you collect log files into a ZIP
file, which provides a convenient means to collect and view the log
files for an instance or a domain even when it is not running.

You configure the Logging Service by setting attributes in the
`logging.properties` file. Each server, configuration, instance, and
cluster in the {productName} domain has an
individual `logging.properties` file. The root directory in which these
`logging.properties` files are located is the same directory as for the
`domain.xml` file, typically domain-dir/`config`. The default target
when configuring logging attributes is the DAS. However, you can
optionally target a specific server, instance, or cluster. You can also
target a configuration that is shared by one or more instances or
clusters. The Logging Service can also be configured using the
Administration Console.

Log levels such as `SEVERE`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `CONFIG`, and others can
be set to provide different types and amounts of information. The
default setting is `INFO`. Each {productName}
module has its own logger, and each logger has its own namespace. Log
levels can be set globally for all loggers, or individually for
module-specific loggers.

For information about using the Administration Console log viewer and
logging functions, see the Administration Console online help. For
information about using the command line for logging functions, see
"xref:administration-guide.adoc#administering-the-logging-service[Administering the Logging Service]" in {productName} Administration Guide.

[[monitoring-the-system]]

==== Monitoring the System

Monitoring is another helpful tool. It is the process of reviewing the
statistics of a system to improve performance or solve problems. By
monitoring the state of various components and services deployed in
{productName} you can identify performance
bottlenecks, predict failures, perform root cause analysis, and ensure
that everything is functioning as expected. For more information about
monitoring, including JConsole information, see
"xref:administration-guide.adoc#administering-the-monitoring-service[Administering the Monitoring Service]" in {productName} Administration Guide.

[[troubleshooting-tools]]

=== Troubleshooting Tools

Several tools are available that can be used to collect information for
troubleshooting purposes. This section provides basic information about
some of them, and includes the following:

* xref:#operating-system-utilities[Operating System Utilities]
* xref:#stack-traces-and-thread-dumps[Stack Traces and Thread Dumps]
* xref:#visualvm[VisualVM]
* xref:#jvm-command-line-tools[JVM Command-Line Tools]

[[operating-system-utilities]]

==== Operating System Utilities

Operating system utilities, such as `pkginfo` and `showrev` on Solaris
and `rpm` on Linux, are helpful in gathering system information.

The `ps -ef` command provides helpful information about processes that
are running, including their process identification numbers (PIDs).

[[stack-traces-and-thread-dumps]]

==== Stack Traces and Thread Dumps

A stack trace is a user-friendly snapshot of the threads and monitors in
a Virtual Machine for the Java platform (Java Virtual Machine or JVM
machine). A thread dump shows what every thread in a JVM is doing at a
given time and is useful in debugging. When the application server
freezes, hangs, or becomes sluggish for no apparent reason, you should
generate and analyze a thread dump.

This section explains how to obtain a thread dump for {productName}. More information about analyzing the information
contained in a thread dump can be found in
"http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/Stacktrace[An
Introduction to Java Stack Traces]"
(`http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/Stacktrace`).

[[to-obtain-a-server-thread-dump]]

===== To Obtain a Server Thread Dump

Type the following command:

[source]
----
asadmin generate-jvm-report --type=thread
----

xref:reference-manual.adoc#generate-jvm-report[`generate-jvm-report`(1)]

[[visualvm]]

==== VisualVM

VisualVM is a Java troubleshooting tool that uses various technologies
such as `jvmstat`, JMX, and Attach API to access monitored applications.
VisualVM is a tool for visualizing data sources and by default
visualizes the following types: applications, hosts, snapshots, core
dumps, heap dumps, and thread dumps. These data sources are visualized
in VisualVM so that they can be monitored for the purposes of analysis,
management, and troubleshooting. VisualVM is commonly used to detect
memory leaks.

VisualVM has a GlassFish plugin that enhances monitoring of hosted
applications by adding specialized overview, a tab for monitoring the
HTTP Service, and the ability to visually select and monitor any of the
deployed web applications. You can experiment with VisualVM
troubleshooting capabilities, but note that various features depend on
the Java versions used in the client and server. Depending on your
configuration, you might only get parts of the VisualVM features. For
more information about VisualVM, see `http://visualvm.java.net`.

[[jvm-command-line-tools]]

==== JVM Command-Line Tools

JVM command-line tools can be used to provide valuable information about
hung Java processes or Java core dumps. These tools include the
following:

* `jstack`: Prints Java stack traces of Java threads for a given Java
process or core file or a remote debug server.
* `jinfo`: Prints Java configuration information for a given Java
process or core file or a remote debug server.
* `jmap`: Prints shared object memory maps or heap memory details for a
given process or core file or a remote debug server.
* `jsadebugd`: Attaches to a Java process or core file and acts as a
debug server. Remote clients such as `jstack`, `jmap`, and `jinfo` can
attach to the server using Java Remote Invocation Method (RMI).
* `jhat`: Enables Java heap dumps to be browsed using a web browser.
* `jstat`: Displays performance statistics for an instrumented HotSpot JVM.
* `jps`: Lists the instrumented HotSpot JVMs on the target system
