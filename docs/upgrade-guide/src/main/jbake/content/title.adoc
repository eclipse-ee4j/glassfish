Upgrade Guide

Release 5.1

Contributed 2018, 2019

This guide explains how to upgrade to Eclipse GlassFish Server 
5.1 from previous GlassFish Server and Sun GlassFish Enterprise
Server product releases. Also included in this guide are instructions
for upgrading configuration data and Java EE applications from
binary-compatible earlier versions of this software to work with
Eclipse GlassFish Server 5.1. Finally, this guide describes
compatibility issues that affect data and applications that are to be
migrated.

Note: The main thrust of the Eclipse GlassFish Server 5.1
release is to provide an application server for developers to explore
and begin exploiting the new and updated technologies in the Java EE 7
platform. Thus, the upgrade feature of GlassFish Server was not a focus
of this release. The feature is included in the release, but it may not
function properly with some of the new features added in support of the
Java EE 7 platform.
