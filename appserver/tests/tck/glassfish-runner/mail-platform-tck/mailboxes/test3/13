"Frentress, James" <James.Frentress@METROKC.GOV> asks:
>> Any guys out there doing distributed object using beans?
>> Any one know whats the progress for distributed object with java?

My company, GemStone Systems, Inc. has introduced a Java distributed
application object server called GemStone/J in which the client API is
expressed as a set of beans, and which provides tools that allow you to build
remote bean adaptors easily.  See http://www.gemstone.com/Products/java.htm
