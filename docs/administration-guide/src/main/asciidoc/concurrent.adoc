== 14 Administering Concurrent Resources

This chapter provides procedures for administering concurrent resources
in the {productName} environment by using the `asadmin` command-line
utility.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<About Concurrent Resources>>
* <<Default Concurrent Resources>>
* <<Configuring Context Services>>
* <<Configuring Managed Thread Factories>>
* <<Configuring Managed Executor Services>>
* <<Configuring Managed Scheduled Executor Services>>

Instructions for accomplishing these tasks by using the Administration
Console are contained in the Administration Console online help.

[[about-concurrent-resources]]

=== About Concurrent Resources

Concurrent resources are managed objects that provide concurrency
capabilities to Jakarta EE applications. In {productName}, you configure
concurrent resources and make them available for use by application
components such as servlets and EJBs. Concurrent resources are accessed
through JNDI lookup or resource injection.

Concurrent resources are resources of the following types:

* Context services. See <<Configuring Context Services>>.
* Managed thread factories. <<Configuring Managed Thread Factories>>.
* Managed executor services. See <<Configuring Managed Executor Services>>.
* Managed scheduled executor services. <<Configuring Managed Scheduled Executor Services>>.

For detailed information about concurrent resources, see
https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-tutorial/#jakarta-concurrency-2[Concurrency Utilities]
in The Jakarta EE Tutorial. Also see
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=236[
Java Specification Request 236: Concurrency Utilities for Jakarta EE].

[[default-concurrent-resources]]

=== Default Concurrent Resources

When you create a concurrent resource, you specify a unique JNDI name
for the resource. Applications use this name to access the resource.

The Jakarta EE standard specifies that certain default resources be made
available to applications, and defines specific JNDI names for these
default resources. {productName} makes these names available through
the use of logical JNDI names, which map Jakarta EE standard JNDI names to
specific {productName} resources. For concurrent resources, the
mappings are as follows:

java:comp/DefaultContextService::
  This Jakarta EE standard name is mapped to the
  `concurrent/__defaultContextService` resource.
java:comp/DefaultManagedThreadFactory::
  This Jakarta EE standard name is mapped to the
  `concurrent/__defaultManagedThreadFactory` resource.
java:comp/DefaultManagedExecutorService::
  This Jakarta EE standard name is mapped to the
  `concurrent/__defaultManagedExecutorService` resource.
java:comp/DefaultManagedScheduledExecutorService::
  This Jakarta EE standard name is mapped to the
  `concurrent/__defaultManagedScheduledExecutorService` resource.

[[configuring-context-services]]

=== Configuring Context Services

Context services are used to create dynamic proxy objects that capture
the context of a container and enable applications to run within that
context at a later time. The context of the container is propagated to
the thread executing the task.

The following tasks are used to administer context service resources:

* <<To Create a Context Service>>
* <<To List Context Services>>
* <<To Update a Context Service>>
* <<To Delete a Context Service>>

[[to-create-a-context-service]]

==== To Create a Context Service

Use the `create-context-service` subcommand in remote mode to create a
context service resource.

Because all JNDI names are in the `java:comp/env` subcontext, when
specifying the JNDI name of a context service, use only the
`concurrent/`name format. For example, `concurrent/Context1`.

For more information about the default context service resource included
with {productName}, see <<Default Concurrent Resources>>.


[NOTE]
====
Creating a context service resource is a dynamic event and typically
does not require server restart. Applications can use a resource as soon
as it is created. However, if an application tried to use a resource
before it was created, and that resource is created later, the
application or the server must be restarted. Otherwise, the application
will not be able to locate the resource.
====


1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Create a context service by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-jdbc-resource[`create-context-service`] subcommand.
3. If necessary, notify users that the new resource has been created.

[[sthref74]]
Example 14-1 Creating a Context Service

This example creates a context service resource named
`concurrent/Context1`.

[source]
----
asadmin> create-context-service concurrent/Context1
Context service concurrent/Context1 created successfully.
Command create-context-service executed successfully.
----

See Also

You can also view the full syntax and options of the subcommand by
typing `asadmin help create-context-service` at the command line.

[[to-list-context-services]]

==== To List Context Services

Use the `list-context-services` subcommand in remote mode to list the
existing context service resources.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. List context service resources by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-jdbc-resources[`list-context-services`] subcommand.

[[sthref75]]
Example 14-2 Listing Context Services

This example lists context service resources on the default server
instance, `server`.

[source]
----
asadmin> list-context-services
concurrent/__defaultContextService
concurrent/Context1
concurrent/Context2
Command list-context-services executed successfully.
----

You can also view the full syntax and options of the subcommand by
typing `asadmin help list-context-services` at the command line.

[[to-update-a-context-service]]

==== To Update a Context Service

You can change all of the settings for an existing context service
resource except its JNDI name. Use the `get` and `set` subcommands to
view and change the values of the context service attributes.


[NOTE]
====
When a resource is updated, the existing resource is shut down and
recreated. If an application used the resource prior to the update, the
application or the server must be restarted.
====


1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. List the context service resources by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-jdbc-connection-pools[`list-context-services`] subcommand.
3. View the attributes of a specific context service by using the `get` subcommand.
For example:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> get resources.context-service.concurrent/Context1.*
----
4. Set an attribute of the context service by using the `set` subcommand.
For example:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> set resources.context-service.concurrent/Context1.deployment-order=120
----

[[to-delete-a-context-service]]

==== To Delete a Context Service

Use the `delete-context-service` subcommand in remote mode to delete an
existing context service. Deleting a context service is a dynamic event
and does not require server restart.

Before deleting a context service resource, all associations to the
resource must be removed.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. List the context service resources by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-jdbc-connection-pools[`list-context-services`] subcommand.
3. If necessary, notify users that the context service is being deleted.
4. Delete the context service by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#delete-jdbc-connection-pool[`delete-context-service`] subcommand.

[[sthref76]]

Managed thread factories are used by applications to create managed
threads on demand. The threads are started and managed by the container.
The context of the container is propagated to the thread executing the
task.

The following tasks are used to administer managed thread factory
resources:

* <<To Create a Managed Thread Factory>>
* <<To List Managed Thread Factories>>
* <<To Update a Managed Thread Factory>>
* <<To Delete a Managed Thread Factory>>

[[to-create-a-managed-thread-factory]]

==== To Create a Managed Thread Factory

Use the `create-managed-thread-factory` subcommand in remote mode to
create a managed thread factory resource.
