[[enabling-debugging]]

=== Enabling Debugging

When you enable debugging, you enable both local and remote debugging.
To start the server in debug mode, use the `--debug` option as follows:

[source]
----
asadmin start-domain --debug [domain-name]
----

You can then attach to the server from the Java Debugger (`jdb`) at its
default Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) port, which is 9009.
For example, for UNIX systems:

[source]
----
jdb -attach 9009
----

For more information about the `jdb` debugger, see the following links:

* Java Platform Debugger Architecture - The Java Debugger:
`https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/jpda/architecture.html`
`https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/jpda/jpda.html`
* Java Platform Debugger Architecture - Connecting with JDB:
`https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/jdb.html`

{productName} debugging is based on the JPDA. For more information,
see xref:#jpda-options[JPDA Options].

You can attach to the {productName} using any JPDA compliant debugger.

You can enable debugging even when the {productName} is started
without the `--debug` option.
This is useful if you start the {productName} from the Windows Start Menu,
or if you want to make sure that debugging is always turned on.

[[to-set-the-server-to-automatically-start-up-in-debug-mode]]

==== To Set the Server to Automatically Start Up in Debug Mode

1. Use the Administration Console. Select the JVM Settings component
under the relevant configuration.
2. Check the Debug Enabled box.
3. To specify a different port (from 9009, the default) to use when
attaching the JVM software to a debugger, specify ``address=``port-number
in the Debug Options field.
4. To add JPDA options, add any desired JPDA debugging options in Debug
Options. See xref:#jpda-options[JPDA Options].

For details, click the Help button in the Administration Console from
the JVM Settings page.

[[jpda-options]]

=== JPDA Options

The default JPDA options in {productName} are as follows:

[source]
----
-Xdebug -agentlib:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=9009
----

For Windows, you can change `dt_socket` to `dt_shmem`.

If you substitute `suspend=y`, the JVM software starts in suspended mode
and stays suspended until a debugger attaches to it. This is helpful if
you want to start debugging as soon as the JVM software starts.

To specify a different port (from 9009, the default) to use when
attaching the JVM software to a debugger, specify `address=`port-number.

You can include additional options. A list of JPDA debugging options is
available at
`http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/toolsapis/jpda/`.

[[generating-a-stack-trace-for-debugging]]

=== Generating a Stack Trace for Debugging

To generate a Java stack trace for debugging, use the
`asadmin generate-jvm-report --type=thread` command. The stack trace
goes to the domain-dir`/logs/server.log` file and also appears on the
command prompt screen. For more information about the
`asadmin generate-jvm-report` command, see the xref:reference-manual.adoc#GSRFM[{productName} Reference Manual].

[[application-client-debugging]]

=== Application Client Debugging

When the `appclient` script executes the `java` command to run the
Application Client Container (ACC), which in turn runs the client, it
includes on the command line the value of the `VMARGS` environment
variable. You can set this variable to any suitable value. For example:

[source]
----
VMARGS=-agentlib:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8118
----

For debugging an application client, you should set suspend to `y` so
you can connect the debugger to the client before any code has actually
executed. Otherwise, the client may start running and execute past the
point you want to examine.

You should use different ports for the server and client if you are
debugging both concurrently. For details about setting the port, see
xref:#jpda-options[JPDA Options].

You can also include JVM options in the `appclient` script directly. For
information about the `appclient` script, see the xref:reference-manual.adoc#GSRFM[{productName} Reference Manual].


[NOTE]
====
The Application Client Container is supported only in the full {productName}, not in the Web Profile. See
xref:java-clients.adoc#developing-java-clients[Developing Java Clients].
====


[[open-message-queue-debugging]]

=== Open Message Queue Debugging

Open Message Queue has a broker logger, which can be useful for
debugging Java Message Service (JMS) applications, including
message-driven bean applications. You can adjust the logger's verbosity,
and you can send the logger output to the broker's console using the
broker's `-tty` option. For more information, see the xref:{mq-admin-guide-url}[Open
Message Queue Administration Guide].


[NOTE]
====
JMS resources are supported only in the full {productName}, not in
the Web Profile. See xref:jms.adoc#using-the-java-message-service[Using the Java Message Service].
====


[[enabling-verbose-mode]]

=== Enabling Verbose Mode

To have the server logs and messages printed to `System.out` on your
command prompt screen, you can start the server in verbose mode. This
makes it easy to do simple debugging using print statements, without
having to view the `server.log` file every time.

To start the server in verbose mode, use the `--verbose` option as
follows:

[source]
----
asadmin start-domain --verbose [domain-name]
----

When the server is in verbose mode, messages are logged to the console
or terminal window in addition to the log file. In addition, pressing
Ctrl-C stops the server and pressing Ctrl-\ (on UNIX platforms) or
Ctrl-Break (on Windows platforms) prints a thread dump. On UNIX
platforms, you can also print a thread dump using the `jstack` command
(see
`http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/share/jstack.html`)
or the command `kill -QUIT` process_id.

[[class-loader-debugging]]

=== Class Loader Debugging

To generate class loading messages, use the following
`asadmin create-jvm-options` command:

[source]
----
asadmin create-jvm-options -verbose\:class
----

To send the JVM messages to a special JVM log file instead of `stdout`,
use the following `asadmin create-jvm-options` commands:

[source]
----
asadmin create-jvm-options -XX\:+LogVMOutput
asadmin create-jvm-options -XX\:LogFile=${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/logs/jvm.log
----


[NOTE]
====
These `-XX` options are specific to the OpenJDK (or Hotspot) JVM and do
not work with the JRockit JVM.
====


To send the {productName} messages to the Administration Console
instead of `stderr`, start the domain in verbose mode as described in
xref:#enabling-verbose-mode[Enabling Verbose Mode].

[[glassfish-server-logging]]

=== {productName} Logging

You can use the {productName}'s log files to help debug your
applications. Use the Administration Console. Select the Stand-Alone
Instances component, select the instance from the table, then click the
View Log Files button in the General Information page. Or select the
Cluster component, select the cluster from the table, select the
Instances tab, select the instance from the table, then click the View
Log Files button in the General Information page.

To change logging settings, select Logger Settings under the relevant configuration.

For details about logging, click the Help button in the Administration Console.

[[debug-profiling-tools]]

=== Profiling Tools

You can use a profiler to perform remote profiling on the {productName} to discover bottlenecks in server-side performance. This section
describes how to configure profilers for use with {productName}.

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#the-netbeans-profiler[The NetBeans Profiler]
* xref:#the-hprof-profiler[The HPROF Profiler]
* xref:#the-jprobe-profiler[The JProbe Profiler]

Information about comprehensive monitoring and management support in the
Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition ( J2SE platform) is available at
`http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/index.html`.

[[the-netbeans-profiler]]

==== The NetBeans Profiler

For information on how to use the NetBeans profiler, see
`http://profiler.netbeans.org/index.html`.

[[the-hprof-profiler]]

==== The HPROF Profiler

The Heap and CPU Profiling Agent (HPROF) is a simple profiler agent
shipped with the Java 2 SDK. It is a dynamically linked library that
interacts with the Java Virtual Machine Profiler Interface (JVMPI) and
writes out profiling information either to a file or to a socket in
ASCII or binary format.

HPROF can monitor CPU usage, heap allocation statistics, and contention
profiles. In addition, it can also report complete heap dumps and states
of all the monitors and threads in the Java virtual machine. For more
details on the HPROF profiler, see the technical article at
`http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/HPROF.html`.

After HPROF is enabled using the following instructions, its libraries
are loaded into the server process.

[[to-use-hprof-profiling-on-unix]]

===== To Use HPROF Profiling on UNIX

1. Use the Administration Console. Select the JVM Settings component
under the relevant configuration. Then select the Profiler tab.
2. Edit the following fields:
* Profiler Name - `hprof`
* Profiler Enabled - `true`
* Classpath - (leave blank)
* Native Library Path - (leave blank)
* JVM Option - Select Add, type the HPROF JVM option in the Value field,
then check its box. The syntax of the HPROF JVM option is as follows:

----
Here is an example of params you can use:
+
[source]
----
-Xrunhprof:file=log.txt,thread=y,depth=3
----
The file parameter determines where the stack dump is written.
+
Using help lists parameters that can be passed to HPROF. The output is
as follows:
+
[source]
----
Hprof usage: -Xrunhprof[:help]|[:<option>=<value>, ...]

== Option Name and Value   Description             Default   -----------             -------
