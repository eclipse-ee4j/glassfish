== 2 Administering User Security

This chapter provides instructions for administering user security in
the {productName} environment by using the `asadmin`
command-line utility. {productName} enforces its authentication and
authorization policies upon realms, users, and groups. This chapter
assumes that you are familiar with security features such as
authentication, authorization, and certificates. If you are not, see
xref:system-security.adoc#administering-system-security[Administering System Security].

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#administering-authentication-realms[Administering Authentication Realms]
* xref:#administering-file-users[Administering File Users]

Instructions for accomplishing these tasks by using the Administration
Console are contained in the Administration Console online help.

[NOTE]
====
JSR-375 defines the concept of an Identity Store, and an SPI interface
for writing providers that can authenticate users against Identity
Stores. It also provides two built-in providers. This mechanism is
conceptually similar to Authentication Realms, but can be configured and
managed by applications. See
https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-tutorial/#working-with-identity-stores[
Working with Identity Stores]
in The Jakarta EE Tutorial for more information about Identity Stores.

[[overview-of-authentication-realms]]

==== Overview of Authentication Realms

An authentication realm, also called a security policy domain or
security domain, is a scope over which the {productName} defines and
enforces a common security policy. {productName} is preconfigured
with the file, certificate, and administration realms. In addition, you
can set up LDAP, JDBC, digest, Oracle Solaris, or custom realms. An
application can specify which realm to use in its deployment descriptor.
If the application does not specify a realm, {productName} uses its
default realm (`file`).

File realm::
  {productName} stores user credentials locally in a file named
  `keyfile`. The file realm is the initial default realm.
Administration realm::
  The administration realm is also a file realm and stores administrator
  user credentials locally in a file named `admin-keyfile`.
Certificate realm::
  {productName} stores user credentials in a certificate database.
  When using the certificate realm, the server uses certificates with
  the HTTPS protocol to authenticate web clients.
LDAP realm::
  {productName} can get user credentials from a Lightweight Directory
  Access Protocol (LDAP) server such as Oracle Virtual Directory (OVD)
  (`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/id-mgmt/overview/index.html`),
  Oracle Internet Directory (OID)
  (`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/products/index.html`), and
  Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition
  (`http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/identity-management/oracle-directory-services/index.html`).
  LDAP is a protocol for enabling anyone to locate organizations,
  individuals, and other resources such as files and devices in a
  network, whether on the public Internet or on a corporate intranet. +
  See xref:#to-configure-ldap-authentication-with-oid[To Configure LDAP Authentication with OID] for
  instructions on configuring {productName} to work with an OVD/OID
  LDAP provider.
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, {productName} performs LDAP group search. If you have
not created any groups in LDAP, the search fails.

To disable LDAP group search in LDAP user name search, set the
`com.oracle.enterprise.security.auth.realm.ldap.DISABLEGROUP_SEARCH`
Java system property to `true` in the required {productName}
instance or cluster configurations:
[source]
----
asadmin> create-jvm-options --target=target
-Dcom.oracle.enterprise.security.auth.realm.ldap.DISABLEGROUP_SEARCH=true
----
where target is the {productName} instance or cluster for which you
are disabling LDAP group search. For more information about the
`create-jvm-options` subcommand, see the xref:reference-manual.adoc#GSRFM[{productName} Reference Manual].
====

JDBC realm::
  {productName} gets user credentials from a database. The server
  uses the database information and the enabled JDBC realm option in the
  configuration file.
Digest realm::
  Digest Authentication authenticates a user based on a user name and a
  password. However, the authentication is performed by transmitting the
  password in an encrypted form.
Oracle Solaris realm::
  {productName} gets user credentials from the Oracle Solaris
  operating system. This realm is supported on the Oracle Solaris 9 and
  Oracle Solaris 10 operating systems. Consult your Oracle Solaris
  documentation for information about managing users and groups in the
  Oracle Solaris realm.
PAM realm::
  A Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) realm allows applications
  deployed on {productName} to authenticate users against a native
  Unix (Solaris/Linux/Mac OS) users list. PAM realms use the class name
  `com.sun.enterprise.security.auth.realm.pam.PamRealm` and the JAAS
  Context `pamRealm`. +
  This realm is supported on all Unix Operating Systems, including the
  Oracle Solaris 9 and Oracle Solaris 10 operating systems
Custom realm::
  You can create other repositories for user credentials, such as a
  relational database or third-party components. For more information
  about custom realms, see the Administration Console online help. For
  instructions on creating a custom realm, see
  "xref:application-development-guide.adoc#creating-a-custom-realm[
  Creating a Custom Realm]" in
  {productName} Application Development Guide.

The {productName} authentication service can govern users in multiple realms.

[[to-configure-a-jdbc-or-digest-authentication-realm]]

==== To Configure a JDBC or Digest Authentication Realm

{productName} enables you to specify a user's credentials (user name
and password) in the JDBC realm instead of in the connection pool. Using
the `jdbc` type realm instead of the connection pool prevents other
applications from browsing the database tables for user credentials.


[NOTE]
====
By default, storage of passwords as clear text is not supported in the
JDBC realm. Under normal circumstances, passwords should not be stored
as clear text.
====


1. [[ggmxh]]

configured already. Configure the OID instance in the server
authentication mode and with the protocol version set to SSLv3 +
Instructions for configuring SSL for OID are provided in the SSL chapter
of Oracle Internet Directory Administrator's Guide
(`http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B14099_19/idmanage.1012/b14082/ssl.html`).

4. Using Oracle Wallet Manager, export an SSL self-signed certificate
you want to use with {productName}. +
Instructions for using Oracle Wallet Manager to create and export SSL
certificates are provided in the "Configure Oracle Internet Directory
for SSL" (`http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B14099_19/idmanage.1012/b14082/ssl.html#CHDCADIJ`)
section of the SSL chapter in Oracle Internet Directory Administrator's
Guide (`http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B14099_19/idmanage.1012/b14082/ssl.html`).

5. On the {productName} side, use the `keytool` command import the
certificate you exported with Oracle Wallet Manager. +
The `keytool` command is available in the `$JAVA_HOME/bin` directory.
Use the following syntax:
+
[source]
----
keytool -importcert -alias "alias-name" -keystore domain-dir/config/cacerts.jks
-file cert-name
----
+
where the variables are defined as follows:
+
--
alias-name::
  Name of an alias to use for the certificate
domain-dir::
  Name of the domain for which the certificate is used
cert-name::
  Path to the certificate that you exported with Oracle Wallet Manager.
--
+
For example, to import a certificate named `oi.cer` for a {productName} domain in `/glassfish7/glassfish/domains/domain1`, using an
alias called "OID self-signed certificate," you would use the following command:
+
[source]
----
keytool -importcert -alias "OID self signed certificate" -keystore \
/glassfish7/glassfish/domains/domain1/config/cacerts.jks -file oid.cer
----
6. Restart the {productName} domain. +
See "xref:administration-guide.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart a Domain]"
in {productName} Administration Guide.
7. Use the Oracle Enterprise Manager `ldapmodify` command to enable
Anonymous Bind for OID. +
For example:
+
[source]
----
ldapmodify -D cn=orcladmin -q -p portNum -h hostname -f ldifFile
----
In this example, the LDIF file might contain the following:
+
[source]
----
dn: cn=oid1,cn=osdldapd,cn=subconfigsubentry
changetype: modify
replace: orclAnonymousBindsFlag
orclAnonymousBindsFlag: 1
----
To disable all anonymous binds, you would use a similar LDIF file with
the last line changed to:
+
[source]
----
orclAnonymousBindsFlag: 0
----

[[administering-file-users]]

=== Administering File Users

A user is an individual (or application program) identity that is
defined in {productName}. A user who has been authenticated is
sometimes called a principal.

As the administrator, you are responsible for integrating users into the
{productName} environment so that their credentials are securely
established and they are provided with access to the applications and
services that they are entitled to use.

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#to-create-a-file-user[To Create a File User]
* xref:#to-list-file-users[To List File Users]
* xref:#to-list-file-groups[To List File Groups]
* xref:#to-update-a-file-user[To Update a File User]
* xref:#to-delete-a-file-user[To Delete a File User]

[[to-create-a-file-user]]

==== To Create a File User

Use the `create-file-user` subcommand in remote mode to create a new
user by adding a new entry to the `keyfile`. The entry includes the user
name, password, and any groups for the user. Multiple groups can be
specified by separating the groups with colons (:).

[NOTE]
====
If secure administration is enabled as described in
xref:administrative-security.adoc#running-secure-admin[Running Secure Admin], you cannot
create an administrative user with a blank password.
====

Creating a new `file` realm user is a dynamic event and does not require
server restart.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. If the user will belong to a particular group, see the current
groups by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-file-groups[`list-file-groups`] subcommand.
3. Create a file user by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-file-user[`create-file-user`] subcommand.

[[ggpkq]]
Example 2-5 Creating a User

This example create user `Jennifer` on the default realm `file` (no groups are specified).

The `asadmin` `--passwordfile` option specifies the name of a file that
contains the password entries in a specific format. The entry for a
password must have the `AS_ADMIN_` prefix followed by the password name
in uppercase letters, an equals sign, and the password. See
xref:reference-manual.adoc#asadmin[`asadmin`(1M)] for more information.

[source]
----
asadmin> create-file-user --user admin
--passwordfile=c:\tmp\asadminpassword.txt Jennifer

----

See Also

You can also view the full syntax and options of the subcommand by
typing `asadmin help list-file-users` at the command line.

[[to-list-file-groups]]

==== To List File Groups

A group is a category of users classified by common traits, such as job
title or customer profile. For example, users of an e-commerce
application might belong to the `customer` group, and the big spenders
might also belong to the `preferred` group. Categorizing users into
groups makes it easier to control the access of large numbers of users.
A group is defined for an entire server and realm. A user can be
associated with multiple groups of users.

A group is different from a role in that a role defines a function in an
application, while a group is a set of users who are related in some
way. For example, in the personnel application there might be groups
such as `full-time`, `part-time`, and `on-leave`. Users in these groups
are all employees (the `employee` role). In addition, each user has its
own designation that defines an additional level of employment.

Use the `list-file-groups` subcommand in remote mode to list groups for
a file user, or all file groups if the `--name` option is not specified.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. List file groups by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-file-groups[`list-file-groups`] subcommand.

[[ghlgb]]
Example 2-7 Listing Groups for a User

This example lists the groups for user `joesmith`.

information in the `keyfile` for a specified user.

[NOTE]
====
If secure administration is enabled as described in
xref:administrative-security.adoc#running-secure-admin[Running Secure Admin], you cannot
update an administrative user to have a blank password.
====

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Update the user information by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#update-file-user[`update-file-user`] subcommand.
