[[overview-of-oracle-toplink]]

=== Overview of Oracle TopLink

Oracle TopLink is the default persistence provider in {productName}. It is a comprehensive standards-based object-persistence and
object-transformation framework that provides APIs, schemas, and
run-time services for the persistence layer of an application.

TopLink includes all of EclipseLink, from the Eclipse Foundation.
EclipseLink is the default persistence provider in {productName}. EclipseLink is the open source implementation of the
development framework and the runtime provided in TopLink. EclipseLink
implements the following specifications, plus value-added extensions:

* Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) 2.0.
+
JPA 2.0 is part of Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 6 (Jakarta EE 6). It
includes improvements and enhancements to domain modeling,
object/relational mapping, `EntityManager` and `Query` interfaces, and
the Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL). It includes an API for
criteria queries, a metamodel API, and support for validation. The Java
Persistence API can be used with non-EJB components outside the EJB
container.
+
For the JPA 2.0 Specification, see
http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/pfd/jsr317/index.html[Java
Specification Request (JSR) 317]. For basic information about the Java
Persistence API, see
https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-tutorial/#persistence[Persistence]
in The Jakarta EE Tutorial.
* Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) 2.0. The EclipseLink JAXB
implementation, plus EclipseLink extensions, is called MOXy. The
`org.eclipse.persistence.moxy.jar` file is bundled with {productName}. For more information about MOXy support in {productName}, see
xref:webservices.adoc#the-databinding-provider[The Databinding Provider].
+
For the JAXB 2.0 specification, see
http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/pfd/jsr222/index.html[Java
Specification Request (JSR) 222].
* EclipseLink utilities are not included but can be used with {productName}. Download the EclipseLink zip file at
`http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/downloads/` and unzip it. The
utility files are located here:

In addition to all of EclipseLink, Oracle TopLink includes TopLink Grid,
an integration between TopLink and Oracle Coherence that allows TopLink
to use Oracle Coherence as a level 2 (L2) cache and persistence layer
for entities. The `toplink-grid.jar` file is bundled with {productName}.


[NOTE]
====
You must have a license for Oracle Coherence to be able to use TopLink
Grid.

[[using-oracle-toplink-in-glassfish-server]]

=== Using Oracle TopLink in {productName}

To run TopLink JPA applications in {productName}, you must configure
the server and coordinate certain server and application settings. These
are described in the following steps. For a summary of these steps, see
"http://docs.oracle.com/html/E25034_01/tlandgs.html#CIHDDACF[Using
TopLink with WebLogic Server]" in Oracle Fusion Middleware Solution
Guide for Oracle TopLink. For more detailed explanations of these steps,
see the links in the steps.

1. Set up the datasource. See "xref:administration-guide.adoc#administering-database-connectivity[
Administering Database Connectivity]"
in {productName} Administration Guide.
2. Create the application. For guidance in writing your application,
see https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-tutorial/#persistence[Persistence]
in The Jakarta EE Tutorial.
3. Create the `persistence.xml` file. See xref:#specifying-the-database-for-an-application[Specifying the
Database for an Application] for considerations specific to {productName}.
+
If you are using the Java Persistence API by calling
`Persistence.createEMF()`, see xref:#specifying-the-persistence-provider-for-an-application[Specifying the Persistence
Provider for an Application].
4. If the security manager is enabled and you are using the Java
Persistence API by calling `Persistence.createEMF()`, see
xref:securing-apps.adoc#enabling-and-disabling-the-security-manager[Enabling and Disabling the Security
Manager].
5. Deploy the application. See the {productName}
Application Deployment Guide.
6. Run the application. See "Application Client Launch" and "To Launch
an Application" in Administration Console online help.
7. Monitor the application. See "xref:administration-guide.adoc#administering-the-monitoring-service[
Administering the Monitoring Service]"
in {productName} Administration Guide.

[[specifying-the-database-for-an-application]]

=== Specifying the Database for an Application

{productName} uses the bundled Apache Derby database by default,
named `jdbc/__default`. If the `transaction-type` element is omitted or
specified as `JTA` and both the `jta-data-source` and
`non-jta-data-source` elements are omitted in the `persistence.xml`
file, Apache Derby is used as a JTA data source. If `transaction-type`
is specified as `RESOURCE_LOCAL` and both `jta-data-source` and
`non-jta-data-source` are omitted, Apache Derby is used as a non-JTA
data source.

To use a non-default database, either specify a value for the
`jta-data-source` element, or set the `transaction-type` element to
`RESOURCE_LOCAL` and specify a value for the `non-jta-data-source`
element.

If you are using the default persistence provider, the provider attempts
to automatically detect the database type based on the connection
metadata. This database type is used to issue SQL statements specific to
the detected database type's dialect. You can specify the optional
`eclipselink.target-database` property to guarantee that the database
type is correct. For example:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <persistence xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence">
        <persistence-unit name ="em1">
            <jta-data-source>jdbc/MyDB2DB</jta-data-source>
            <properties>
                <property name="eclipselink.target-database"
                    value="DB2"/>
            </properties>
        </persistence-unit>
    </persistence>
----

The following `eclipselink.target-database` property values are allowed.
Supported platforms have been tested with the {productName} and are
found to be Jakarta EE compatible.

Application Server]
(`http://wiki.eclipse.org/Using_EclipseLink_JPA_Extensions_(ELUG)#Using_EclipseLink_JPA_Extensions_for_Session.2C_Target_Database_and_Target_Application_Server`).

If you are using the Java Persistence API by calling
`Persistence.createEMF()`, do not specify the `jta-data-source` or
`non-jta-data-source` elements. Instead, specify the `provider` element
and any additional properties required by the JDBC driver or the
database. For example:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <persistence xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence" version="1.0">
        <persistence-unit name ="em2">
            <provider>org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider</provider>
            <class>ejb3.war.servlet.JpaBean</class>
            <properties>
                <property name="eclipselink.target-database"
                    value="Derby"/>
                <!-- JDBC connection properties -->
                <property name="eclipselink.jdbc.driver" value="org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver"/>
                <property name="eclipselink.jdbc.url"
value="jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/testdb;retrieveMessagesFromServerOnGetMessage=true;create=true;"/>
                <property name="eclipselink.jdbc.user" value="APP"/>
                <property name="eclipselink.jdbc.password" value="APP"/>
            </properties>
        </persistence-unit>
    </persistence>
----

Notes]. For configurations of supported and other drivers, see
"xref:administration-guide.adoc#configuration-specifics-for-jdbc-drivers[Configuration Specifics for JDBC Drivers]" in
{productName} Administration Guide.

[[specifying-the-persistence-provider-for-an-application]]

=== Specifying the Persistence Provider for an Application

If you are using the default persistence provider in an application that
uses the Java Persistence API by injecting or looking up an entity
manager or entity manager factory, you do not need to specify the
provider.

If you are using the Java Persistence API by calling
`Persistence.createEMF()`, you should always specify the persistence
provider for specification compliance. To specify the default provider,
set the `provider` element of the `persistence.xml` file to
`org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider`.

You can specify a non-default persistence provider for an application in
the manner described in the Java Persistence API Specification:

1. Install the provider. Copy the provider JAR files to the
domain-dir``/lib`` directory, and restart the {productName}. For more
information about the domain-dir``/lib`` directory, see
xref:class-loaders.adoc#using-the-common-class-loader[Using the Common Class Loader]. The new
persistence provider is now available to all modules and applications
deployed on servers that share the same configuration.
+
However, the default provider remains the same, Oracle TopLink or
EclipseLink.
2. In your persistence unit, specify the provider and any properties
the provider requires in the `persistence.xml` file. For example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <persistence xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence">
        <persistence-unit name ="em3">
            <provider>com.company22.persistence.PersistenceProviderImpl</provider>
            <properties>
                <property name="company22.database.name" value="MyDB"/>
            </properties>
        </persistence-unit>
    </persistence>
----

To specify the provider programmatically instead of in the
`persistence.xml` file, set the `javax.persistence.provider` property
and pass it to the `Map` parameter of the following method:

[source,java]
----
javax.persistence.Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(String, Map)
----

[[primary-key-generation-defaults]]

=== Primary Key Generation Defaults

In the descriptions of the `@GeneratedValue`, `@SequenceGenerator`, and
`@TableGenerator` annotations in the Java Persistence Specification,
certain defaults are noted as specific to the persistence provider. The
default persistence provider's primary key generation defaults are
listed here.

`@GeneratedValue` defaults are as follows:

* Using `strategy=AUTO` (or no `strategy`) creates a `@TableGenerator`
named `SEQ_GEN` with default settings. Specifying a `generator` has no
effect.
* Using `strategy=TABLE` without specifying a `generator` creates a
`@TableGenerator` named `SEQ_GEN_TABLE` with default settings.
Specifying a `generator` but no `@TableGenerator` creates and names a
`@TableGenerator` with default settings.
* Using `strategy=IDENTITY` or `strategy=SEQUENCE` produces the same
results, which are database-specific.

** For Oracle databases, not specifying a `generator` creates a
`@SequenceGenerator` named `SEQ_GEN_SEQUENCE` with default settings.
Specifying a `generator` but no `@SequenceGenerator` creates and names a
`@SequenceGenerator` with default settings.

** For PostgreSQL databases, a `SERIAL` column named
entity-table`_`pk-column`_SEQ` is created.

** For MySQL databases, an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column is created.

** For other supported databases, an `IDENTITY` column is created.

The `@SequenceGenerator` annotation has one default specific to the
default provider. The default `sequenceName` is the specified `name`.

`@TableGenerator` defaults are as follows:

* The default `table` is `SEQUENCE`.
* The default `pkColumnName` is `SEQ_NAME`.
* The default `valueColumnName` is `SEQ_COUNT`.
* The default `pkColumnValue` is the specified `name`, or the default
`name` if no `name` is specified.

[[automatic-schema-generation]]

=== Automatic Schema Generation

The automatic schema generation feature of the {productName} defines
database tables based on the fields or properties in entities and the
relationships between the fields or properties. This insulates
developers from many of the database related aspects of development,
allowing them to focus on entity development. The resulting schema is
usable as-is or can be given to a database administrator for tuning with
respect to performance, security, and so on.

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#annotations[Annotations]
* xref:#generation-options[Generation Options]


[NOTE]
====
Automatic schema generation is supported on an all-or-none basis: it
expects that no tables exist in the database before it is executed. It
is not intended to be used as a tool to generate extra tables or
constraints.

Deployment won't fail if all tables are not created, and undeployment
won't fail if not all tables are dropped. Instead, an error is written
to the server log. This is done to allow you to investigate the problem
and fix it manually. You should not rely on the partially created
database schema to be correct for running the application.
====


[[annotations]]

==== Annotations

The following annotations are used in automatic schema generation:
`@AssociationOverride`, `@AssociationOverrides`, `@AttributeOverride`,
`@AttributeOverrides`, `@Column`, `@DiscriminatorColumn`,
`@DiscriminatorValue`, `@Embedded`, `@EmbeddedId`, `@GeneratedValue`,
`@Id`, `@IdClass`, `@JoinColumn`, `@JoinColumns`, `@JoinTable`, `@Lob`,
`@ManyToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@OneToOne`,
`@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn`, `@PrimaryKeyJoinColumns`, `@SecondaryTable`,
`@SecondaryTables`, `@SequenceGenerator`, `@Table`, `@TableGenerator`,
`@UniqueConstraint`, and `@Version`. For information about these
annotations, see the Java Persistence Specification.

For `@Column` annotations, the `insertable` and `updatable` elements are
not used in automatic schema generation.

For `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne` annotations, no `ForeignKeyConstraint`
is created in the resulting DDL files.

[[generation-options]]

==== Generation Options

Schema generation properties or `asadmin` command line options can
control automatic schema generation by the following:

* Creating tables during deployment
* Dropping tables during undeployment
* Dropping and creating tables during redeployment
* Generating the DDL files


[NOTE]
====
Before using these options, make sure you have a properly configured
database. See xref:#specifying-the-database-for-an-application[Specifying the Database for an Application].
====


Optional schema generation properties control the automatic creation of
database tables. You can specify them in the `persistence.xml` file. For
more information, see
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Using_EclipseLink_JPA_Extensions_(ELUG)#Using_EclipseLink_JPA_Extensions_for_Schema_Generation[Using
EclipseLink JPA Extensions for Schema Generation]
(`http://wiki.eclipse.org/Using_EclipseLink_JPA_Extensions_(ELUG)#Using_EclipseLink_JPA_Extensions_for_Schema_Generation`).

The following options of the `asadmin deploy` or `asadmin deploydir`
command control the automatic creation of database tables at deployment.

[[gbwlr]]

Table 6-1 The `asadmin deploy` and `asadmin deploydir` Generation Options

[width="181%",cols="14%,49%,37%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Default |Description
|`--createtables` |none |If `true`, causes database tables to be created
for entities that need them. No unique constraints are created. If
`false`, does not create tables. If not specified, the value of the
`eclipselink.ddl-generation` property in `persistence.xml` is used.

|`--dropandcreatetables` |none a|
If `true`, and if tables were automatically created when this
application was last deployed, tables from the earlier deployment are
dropped and fresh ones are created.

If `true`, and if tables were not automatically created when this
application was last deployed, no attempt is made to drop any tables. If
tables with the same names as those that would have been automatically
created are found, the deployment proceeds, but a warning is thrown to
indicate that tables could not be created.

If `false`, the `eclipselink.ddl-generation` property setting in
`persistence.xml` is overridden.

|===


The following options of the `asadmin undeploy` command control the
automatic removal of database tables at undeployment.

[[gbwmm]]

Table 6-2 The `asadmin undeploy` Generation Options

[width="181%",cols="9%,49%,42%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Default |Description
|`--droptables` |none a|
If `true`, causes database tables that were automatically created when
the entities were last deployed to be dropped when the entities are
undeployed. If `false`, does not drop tables.

If not specified, tables are dropped only if the
`eclipselink.ddl-generation` property setting in `persistence.xml` is
`drop-and-create-tables`.

|===


For more information about the `asadmin deploy`, `asadmin deploydir`,
and `asadmin undeploy` commands, see the xref:reference-manual.adoc#GSRFM[{productName} Reference Manual].

When `asadmin` deployment options and `persistence.xml` options are both
specified, the `asadmin` deployment options take precedence.

[[restrictions-and-optimizations]]

=== Restrictions and Optimizations

This section discusses restrictions and performance optimizations that
affect using the Java Persistence API.

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#oracle-database-enhancements[Oracle Database Enhancements]
* xref:#extended-persistence-context[Extended Persistence Context]
* xref:#using-orderby-with-a-shared-session-cache[Using @OrderBy with a Shared Session Cache]

* xref:#database-case-sensitivity[Database Case Sensitivity]
* xref:#sybase-finder-limitation[Sybase Finder Limitation]
* xref:#mysql-database-restrictions[MySQL Database Restrictions]

[[oracle-database-enhancements]]

==== Oracle Database Enhancements

EclipseLink features a number of enhancements for use with Oracle
databases. These enhancements require classes from the Oracle JDBC
driver JAR files to be visible to EclipseLink at runtime. If you place
the JDBC driver JAR files in domain-dir``/lib``, the classes are not
visible to {productName} components, including EclipseLink.

If you are using an Oracle database, put JDBC driver JAR files in
domain-dir``/lib/ext`` instead. This ensures that the JDBC driver classes
are visible to EclipseLink.

If you do not want to take advantage of Oracle-specific extensions from
EclipseLink or you cannot put JDBC driver JAR files in
domain-dir``/lib/ext``, set the `eclipselink.target-database` property to
the value `org.eclipse.persistence.platform.database.OraclePlatform`.
For more information about the `eclipselink.target-database` property,
see xref:#specifying-the-database-for-an-application[Specifying the Database for an Application].

[[extended-persistence-context]]

==== Extended Persistence Context

The Java Persistence API specification does not specify how the
container and persistence provider should work together to serialize an
extended persistence context. This also prevents successful
serialization of a reference to an extended persistence context in a
stateful session bean.

Even in a single-instance environment, if a stateful session bean is
passivated, its extended persistence context could be lost when the
stateful session bean is activated.

Therefore, in {productName}, a stateful session bean with an extended
persistence context is never passivated and cannot be failed over.

[[using-orderby-with-a-shared-session-cache]]

==== Using @OrderBy with a Shared Session Cache

Setting `@OrderBy` on a `ManyToMany` or `OneToMany` relationship field
in which a `List` represents the Many side doesn't work if the session
cache is shared. Use one of the following workarounds:

* Have the application maintain the order so the `List` is cached
properly.
* Refresh the session cache using `EntityManager.refresh()` if you don't
want to maintain the order during creation or modification of the
`List`.
* Disable session cache sharing in `persistence.xml` as follows:
+
[source,xml]
----
<property name="eclipselink.cache.shared.default" value="false"/>
----

[[using-blob-or-clob-types-with-the-inet-oraxo-jdbc-driver]]

==== Using BLOB or CLOB Types with the Inet Oraxo JDBC Driver

To use BLOB or CLOB data types larger than 4 KB for persistence using
the Inet Oraxo JDBC Driver for Oracle Databases, you must set the
database's `streamstolob` property value to `true`.

[[database-case-sensitivity]]

==== Database Case Sensitivity

Mapping references to column or table names must be in accordance with
the expected column or table name case, and ensuring this is the
programmer's responsibility. If column or table names are not explicitly
specified for a field or entity, the {productName} uses upper case
column names by default, so any mapping references to the column or
table names must be in upper case. If column or table names are
explicitly specified, the case of all mapping references to the column
or table names must be in accordance with the case used in the specified
names.

The following are examples of how case sensitivity affects mapping
elements that refer to columns or tables. Keep case sensitivity in mind
when writing these mappings.

[[unique-constraints]]

===== Unique Constraints

If column names are not explicitly specified on a field, unique
constraints and foreign key mappings must be specified using uppercase
references. For example:

[source,java]
----
@Table(name="Department", uniqueConstraints={ @UniqueConstraint ( columnNames= { "DEPTNAME" } ) } )
----

The other way to handle this is by specifying explicit column names for
each field with the required case. For example:

[source,java]
----
@Table(name="Department", uniqueConstraints={ @UniqueConstraint ( columnNames= { "deptName" } ) } )
public class Department{ @Column(name="deptName") private String deptName; }
----

Otherwise, the `ALTER TABLE` statement generated by the {productName}
uses the incorrect case, and the creation of the unique constraint
fails.

[[foreign-key-mapping]]

===== Foreign Key Mapping

Use `@OneToMany(mappedBy="COMPANY")` or specify an explicit column name
for the `Company` field on the `Many` side of the relationship.

[[sql-result-set-mapping]]

===== SQL Result Set Mapping

Use the following elements:

[source,xml]
----
<sql-result-set-mapping name="SRSMName">
   <entity-result entity-class="entities.someEntity" />
   <column-result name="UPPERCASECOLUMNNAME" />
</sql-result-set-mapping>
----

Or specify an explicit column name for the `upperCaseColumnName` field.

[[named-native-queries-and-jdbc-queries]]

===== Named Native Queries and JDBC Queries

Column or table names specified in SQL queries must be in accordance
with the expected case. For example, MySQL requires column names in the
`SELECT` clause of JDBC queries to be uppercase, while PostgreSQL and
Sybase require table names to be uppercase in all JDBC queries.

[[postgresql-case-sensitivity]]

===== PostgreSQL Case Sensitivity

PostgreSQL stores column and table names in lower case. JDBC queries on
PostgreSQL retrieve column or table names in lowercase unless the names
are quoted. For example:

[source,sql]
----
use aliases Select m.ID AS \"ID\" from Department m
----

Use the backslash as an escape character in the class file, but not in
the `persistence.xml` file.

[[sybase-finder-limitation]]

==== Sybase Finder Limitation

If a finder method with an input greater than 255 characters is executed
and the primary key column is mapped to a VARCHAR column, Sybase
attempts to convert type VARCHAR to type TEXT and generates the
following error:

[source]
----
com.sybase.jdbc2.jdbc.SybSQLException: Implicit conversion from datatype
'TEXT' to 'VARCHAR' is not allowed. Use the CONVERT function to run this query.
----

To avoid this error, make sure the finder method input is less than 255
characters.

[[mysql-database-restrictions]]

==== MySQL Database Restrictions

The following restrictions apply when you use a MySQL database with the
{productName} for persistence.

* MySQL treats `int1` and `int2` as reserved words. If you want to
define `int1` and `int2` as fields in your table, use `\`int1\`` and
`\`int2\`` field names in your SQL file.
* When `VARCHAR` fields get truncated, a warning is displayed instead of
an error. To get an error message, start the MySQL database in strict
SQL mode.
* The order of fields in a foreign key index must match the order in the
explicitly created index on the primary table.
* The `CREATE TABLE` syntax in the SQL file must end with the following
line.
+
[source,sql]
----
)  Engine=InnoDB;
----
`InnoDB` provides MySQL with a transaction-safe (ACID compliant) storage
engine having commit, rollback, and crash recovery capabilities.
* For a `FLOAT` type field, the correct precision must be defined. By
default, MySQL uses four bytes to store a `FLOAT` type that does not
have an explicit precision definition. For example, this causes a number
such as 12345.67890123 to be rounded off to 12345.7 during an `INSERT`.
To prevent this, specify `FLOAT(10,2)` in the DDL file, which forces the
database to use an eight-byte double-precision column. For more
information, see `http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/numeric-types.html`.
* To use `||` as the string concatenation symbol, start the MySQL server
with the `--sql-mode="PIPES_AS_CONCAT"` option. For more information,
see `http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-sql-mode.html` and
`http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/ansi-mode.html`.
* MySQL always starts a new connection when `autoCommit==true` is set.
This ensures that each SQL statement forms a single transaction on its
own. If you try to rollback or commit an SQL statement, you get an error
message.
+
[source]
----
javax.transaction.SystemException: java.sql.SQLException:
Can't call rollback when autocommit=true

javax.transaction.SystemException: java.sql.SQLException:
Error open transaction is not closed
----
To resolve this issue, add `relaxAutoCommit=true` to the JDBC URL. For
more information, see `http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?39,31326,31404`.
* MySQL does not allow a `DELETE` on a row that contains a reference to
itself. Here is an example that illustrates the issue.
+
[source,sql]
----
