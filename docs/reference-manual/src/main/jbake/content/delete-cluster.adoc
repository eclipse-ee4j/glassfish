Synopsis

Description

The `delete-cluster` subcommand deletes a \{product---name} cluster. A
cluster can be deleted only if the cluster contains no \{product---name}
instances. If a cluster that you are deleting contains any instances,
stop and delete the instances before deleting the cluster.

If the cluster's named configuration was created automatically for the
cluster and no other clusters or unclustered instances refer to the
configuration, the configuration is deleted when the cluster is deleted.
A configuration that is created automatically for a cluster is named
cluster-name`-config`, where cluster-name is the name of the cluster.

This command is supported in remote mode only.
