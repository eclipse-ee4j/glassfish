Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these
  options, see the link:asadmin.html#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--cascade`::
  If the option is set to true, all the JDBC resources associated with
  the pool, apart from the pool itself, are deleted. When set to false,
  the deletion of pool fails if any resources are associated with the
  pool. Resources must be deleted explicitly or the option must be set
  to true. The default value is false.
`--target`::
  Do not specify this option. This option is retained for compatibility
  with earlier releases. If you specify this option, a syntax error does
  not occur. Instead, the subcommand runs successfully and displays a
  warning message that the option is ignored.
