== disable-monitoring

Disables monitoring for the server or for specific monitorable modules

=== Synopsis

[source]
----
asadmin [asadmin-options] disable-monitoring [--help]
[--modules module-name][:module-name]*
----

=== Description

The `disable-monitoring` subcommand is used to turn off monitoring for
{productName} or for particular modules during runtime. Changes are
dynamic, that is, server restart is not required.

Running the `disable-monitoring` subcommand without the `--module`
option disables the monitoring service by setting the
`monitoring-enabled` attribute of the `monitoring-service` element to
`false`. The individual modules retain their monitoring levels, but no
monitoring data is generated because the entire monitoring service is
disabled.

This subcommand used with the `--modules` option disables monitoring for
a module by setting the monitoring level to OFF. The status of the
monitoring service is not affected. For a list of monitorable modules,
see the `--modules` option in this help page.

An alternative method for disabling monitoring is to use the `set`
subcommand. In this case, the server must be restarted for changes to
take effect.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
