## Eclipse GlassFish 7.x

Eclipse GlassFish is an application server, implementing [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/about).
This release is corresponding with the [Jakarta EE 10](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10) specification, which is a major feature release.
Jakarta EE 10 requires JDK 11 as a minimum, but also officially works on JDK 17.

GlassFish 7.0.25 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs. It compiles and runs on JDK 11 to JDK 24. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.

This update emphasizes major cleanups, system optimizations, and prepares the codebase for easier future maintenance, notably in anticipation of the upcoming 7.1.0 release.
