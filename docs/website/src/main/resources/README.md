## January 3, 2024 -- Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.21 Available

We're over the moon to present you our first release of 2025: GlassFish 7.0.21!

This release was all about hunting down a few nasty bugs reported by GlassFish users: restart hanging on fast machines (including ephemeral ports appearing when stopping GlassFish), random 403 responses for authenticated sessions and Faces that was failing to initialize on GlassFish embedded. We're proud to announce that after a lot of research and a lot of work, we were able to squash them all. A special thanks to our users for reporting these and helping us to narrow them down!

All of us from GlassFish are joyful with the release of GlassFish 7.0.20!

While working on GlassFish 7.1.0 and GlassFish 8, we didn't leave the stable 7.0.x series in the dark. In this release we updated a lot of our dependencies to their latest versions and did a large amount of testing to ensure everything worked as required. We also improved stability again by squashing a number of outstanding bugs.

This release is all about an exciting new feature that allows running GlassFish Embedded from the command line using `java -jar glassfish-embedded.jar`. It supports configuration via command line arguments and/or config files in the current directory, such as setting the HTTP port, deploying applications passed as arguments and running arbitrary AsAdmin commands at boot. Aside of that we did a large amount of maintenance for the internal modules `nucleus-admin` and `glassfish`, and fixed various issues that were reported by users.


## August 30, 2024 -- Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.17 Available

Another great release, Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.17, is here.

Download links are available from the [GlassFish Download page](download.md).

In this summer 2024 release of GlassFish we did a lot of maintenance in which we will continue in future releases. We fixed several security issues and the build now passes also in Java 23.

## July 31, 2024 -- Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.16 Available

With much joy we present you Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.16.

In this summer 2024 release of GlassFish we added several new features. Specifically new is an admin command logger, which logs graphical interactions with the admin UI for usage in scripts. GlassFish now also allows resource references in persistence.xml, and we added a great new feature where we are creating temporary snapshots of the external application libraries during application startup, so any update of these is not longer system dependent. We also did a major refactoring of the aging TLS code and optimized the GJULE logging.


## May 31, 2024 -- Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.15 Available

We are very happy to bring you Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.15.

This release features among others an important NPE fix for the SSHLauncher and is highly recommended for our users who make use of this launcher.

The thread safety of transactions was improved, and the JDBC connection pool sizing logic was also improved, fixing an annoying bug.

To maintain future quality of GlassFish, many fixes to the internal TCKs tests were done.

As a new feature, command completion is now enabled in the OSGi interactive console.

We are very happy to bring you Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.12.

Download links are available from the [GlassFish Download page](download.md).

This release we focused on finding and fixing the root cause of several "strange" WebSocket related bugs that we witnessed in the past. We also did a similar thing related to several issues with running apps on the default context root, especially where after authentication redirects happened to another URL.

Furthermore we looked into problems with authentication and SSO in a cluster and did some initial fixes. Handling and processing of logging was looked at once again, something we have been improving a lot step by step through various iterations of releases.

Finally but not least a nasty ConcurrentModificationException was fixed, and a memory leak (via HK2) was solved.

This release sees an important fix where WebSockets would not work at all for applications on the default context root (e.g. https://example.com vs https://example.com/myapp).

This month we have concentrated on the AdminGUI and fixed an assortment of small but annoying defects in it. Various major components were updated, such as Jersey (Jakarta REST), Tyrus (Jakarta WebSockets) and Mojarra (Jakarta Faces).

To keep the project maintainable and well tested, several tests were added and improved as well.

## October 29, 2023 -- Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.10 Available

The GlassFish team is very happy to present you another great release of GlassFish.

Download links are available from the [GlassFish Download page](download.md).

In this release a 10 months long operation to get an internal dependency to the slf4j-api removed finally got to fruition. This involved the intense cooperation of multiple teams, and we're exceptionally happy to have finally been able to do this.

We also did a lot of work to make our builds repeatable, and we did a ton of refactoring to the internal security packages of GlassFish, making them easier to understand and therefore easier to maintain. Any external code depending on these internal packages (such as potentially custom LoginModules/Realms) may have to update (we recommend of course not depending on internal packages and using public APIs).

As every release, we integrated many component updates, and did a number of smaller fixes.

In this release the modularity of GlassFish is once again increased by moving the Jakarta Authentication implementation code to a new standalone project: [Epicyro](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/epicyro). We also enabled the GlassFish embedded tests again, which were dormant for a long time. Among the many updated components, Exousia was updated specifically to fix a bug with deployments on virtual servers, and the ORB was updated to fix a somewhat obscure bug where a remote EJB returned a JDK defined enum type.

The main features of this release are the updates of various components, fixing a wide array of issues. Specifically with WaSP 3.2.0 a major change is that it now includes the Pages Standard Tags, so the separate jar for this is no longer present in GlassFish. We also fixed an important regression where requesting a directory from the ClassLoader failed for exploded deploys. This now works again. Additionally the version (7.0.2 now) is reported correctly again, which can be important for package managers such as brew.

Eclipse GlassFish 7.0.2 compiles and runs with JDK 11 to JDK 19 releases. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher. JDK 20ea30 has been succesfully used to compile and run GlassFish as well, but is not yet officially supported.
