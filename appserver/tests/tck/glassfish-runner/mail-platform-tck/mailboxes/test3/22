I am about to put the following statement in some sales brochure.  I 
would like to verify its accuracy with you. Any help would be appreciated.


----------------------

The Java Development Kit (JDK) provides an environment that requires no 
compiling, no debugging, and no extra tools.  In fact, Java requires absolutely 
no porting, so it is simpler, easier, and faster than programming in C++.

-----------------------

I got this claim from the web. However, it does not sound right to me due to 
the fact we have debugger tools, etc.

I would appreciate your commments.

Minoo
