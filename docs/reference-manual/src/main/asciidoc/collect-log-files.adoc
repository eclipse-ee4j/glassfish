== collect-log-files

Creates a ZIP archive of all available log files

=== Synopsis

[source]
----
asadmin [asadmin-options] collect-log-files [--help]
[--target target]
[--retrieve={false|true}] [retrievefilepath]]
----

=== Description

The `collect-log-files` subcommand collects all available log files for
the domain administration server (DAS), the specified cluster, or the
specified {productName} instance and creates a single ZIP archive of
the log files. If a cluster is specified, the ZIP archive also contains
the log file for the DAS.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

=== Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these
  options, see the xref:asadmin.adoc#asadmin[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--retrieve`::
  Specifies whether the ZIP archive is created in a directory other than
  the default directory. +
  By default the ZIP archive is created in the
  domain-dir`/collected-logs` directory. The ZIP file names are
  constructed from the specified target and timestamp, as follows:
+
[source]
----
log_yyyy-mm-dd_hh-min-sec.zip
----
+
Possible values are as follows:
+
  `false`;;
    The ZIP archive will be created in the default directory. If
    omitted, the `--retrieve` option defaults to `false`.
  `true`;;
    The ZIP archive will be created in the directory that the
    retrievefilepath operand specifies. If retrievefilepath is omitted,
    the ZIP archive will be created in the default directory.
`--target`::
  Specifies the target for which log files will be collected. +
  Possible values are as follows:

  `server`;;
    The log files will be collected for the DAS (default).
  instance-name;;
    The log files will be collected for the specified {productName} instance.
  cluster-name;;
    The log files will be collected for the specified cluster and the DAS.

=== Operands

retrievefilepath::
  The name of the directory in which the ZIP archive will be created. If
  this operand is omitted, the ZIP archive will be created in the
  default directory. If the `--retrieve` option is `false`, this operand
  is ignored.
