Description

The `attach` subcommand attaches to subcommands that were started using
the `asadmin` utility option `--detach` or that contain progress
information. The `--detach` option detaches long-running subcommands and
executes them in the background in detach mode.

Job IDs are assigned to the subcommands (jobs), and can be used to view
the status of a job and its output. Use the
link:list-jobs.html#list-jobs-1[`list-jobs`(1)] subcommand to view the
jobs and their job IDs, and the
link:configure-managed-jobs.html#configure-managed-jobs-1[`configure-managed-jobs`(1)]
subcommand to configure how long information about the jobs is kept.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
