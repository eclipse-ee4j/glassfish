Hi Everyone:

Please read:  EVACUATION WILL BE NECESSARY when this occurs!
The date for the repairs necessary below is 95% certain to
happen this weekend - there are still two approvals to go.
I wanted to give you as much advance warning as I could so
I am sending this message to you today.  If the date for the
compressor repairs changes to another weekend date I will
get back to all of you immediately.  I am awaiting final
confirmation of the date this afternoon.

There is a component (i,e, a compressor) in one of the air
conditioning units on the roof that has failed and requires
replacement.  This unit supplies the a/c for the west wing 
of the building.  

Due to the heavy weight of the compressor there are two ways to
remove and replace it. That is, either with a crane or with a 
helicopter.  Both methods will be disruptive to people within
the building.  

Facilities will make this major repair on the weekend of June
28th (a Saturday) between the hours of 6:00 a.m. to noon.  In
effect during those hours the building will have to be fully
EVACUATED if a helicopter is used or partially evacuated if a
crane is used (undetermined as of today). It is probably best
to plan your work schedule around the above timetable and
avoid CUP-02 until later in the afternoon for safety's sake.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks
JacKie
