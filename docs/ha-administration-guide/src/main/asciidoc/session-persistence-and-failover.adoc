=== Overview of Session Persistence and Failover

{productName} provides high availability session persistence through
failover of HTTP session data and stateful session bean (SFSB) session
data. Failover means that in the event of an server instance or hardware
failure, another server instance in a cluster takes over a distributed session.

For example, Jakarta EE applications typically have significant amounts of
session state data. A web shopping cart is the classic example of
session state. Also, an application can cache frequently-needed data in
the session object. In fact, almost all applications with significant
user interactions need to maintain session state.

[NOTE]
====
When using high availability session persistence together with a load
balancer, use a load balancer that includes session-based stickiness as
part of its load-balancing algorithm. Otherwise, session data can be
misdirected or lost. An example of a load balancer that includes
session-based stickiness is the Loadbalancer Plug-In available in {productName}.
====

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#requirements[Requirements]
* xref:#restrictions[Restrictions]
* xref:#scope[Scope]

[[requirements]]

==== Requirements

A distributed session can run in multiple {productName}
instances, if:

* Each server instance has access to the same session state data.
{productName} supports in-memory session replication on other servers
in the cluster for maintaining HTTP session and stateful session bean
data. In-memory session replication is enabled by default for {productName} clustered environments if the Group Management Service is enabled.
+
The use of in-memory replication requires the Group Management Service
(GMS) to be enabled. For more information about GMS, see
xref:clusters.adoc#group-management-service[Group Management Service].
+
If server instances in a cluster are located on different hosts, ensure
that the following prerequisites are met:

** To ensure that GMS and in-memory replication function correctly, the
hosts must be on the same subnet.

** To ensure that in-memory replication functions correctly, the system
clocks on all hosts in the cluster must be synchronized as closely as
possible.
+
[NOTE]
====
{productName} 7 does not support High Availability Database (HADB)
configurations. Instead, use in-memory replication, as described in
xref:overview.adoc#high-availability-session-persistence[High Availability Session Persistence].
====

* Each server instance has the same distributable web application
deployed to it. The `web-app` element of the `web.xml` deployment
descriptor file must contain the `distributable` element.

* The web application uses high-availability session persistence. If a
non-distributable web application is configured to use high-availability
session persistence, the server writes an error to the log file.

* The web application must be deployed using the `deploy` or `deploydir`
subcommand with the `--availabilityenabled` option set to `true`. For
more information on these subcommands, see xref:reference-manual.adoc#deploy[`deploy`(1)]
and xref:reference-manual.adoc#deploydir[`deploydir`(1)].

[[restrictions]]

==== Restrictions

When configuring session persistence and failover, note the following restrictions:

* When a session fails over, any references to open files or network
connections are lost. Applications must be coded with this restriction in mind.

* EJB Singletons are created for each server instance in a cluster, and
not once per cluster.

* The high availability session persistence service is not compatible
with dynamic deployment, dynamic reloading, and autodeployment. These
features are for development, not production environments, so you must
disable them before enabling the session persistence service.
For information about how to disable these features, see the
xref:application-deployment-guide.adoc#GSDPG[
{productName} Application Deployment Guide].

* {productName} 7 does not support High Availability Database
(HADB) configurations. Instead, use in-memory replication, as described
in xref:overview.adoc#high-availability-session-persistence[High Availability Session Persistence].

* You can only bind certain objects to distributed sessions that support
failover. Contrary to the Servlet 2.4 specification, {productName} 7 does not throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if an object type not
supported for failover is bound into a distributed session.
+
You can bind the following objects into a distributed session that
supports failover:

** Local home and object references for all EJB components.
** Colocated stateless session, stateful session, or entity bean reference .
** Distributed stateless session, stateful session, or entity bean reference.
** JNDI Context for `InitialContext` and `java:comp/env`.
** `UserTransaction` objects. However, if the instance that fails is
never restarted, any prepared global transactions are lost and might not
be correctly rolled back or committed.
** Serializable Java types.

* You cannot bind the following object types into sessions that support failover:

** JDBC DataSource
** Java Message Service (JMS) `ConnectionFactory` and `Destination` objects
** JavaMail Session
** Connection Factory
** Administered Objects
** Web service reference +
In general, for these objects, failover will not work. However, failover
might work in some cases, if for example the object is serializable.

[[scope]]

Scope
^^^^^

The availability service can be enabled for the following scopes,
ranging from highest to lowest:

* Cluster
* Standalone server instance (not part of a cluster)
* Web, EJB, or JMS container in a cluster
* Application
* Standalone Web, EJB, or JMS module
* Individual Stateful Session Bean (SFSB)

In general, enabling or disabling availability session persistence for a
cluster or container involves setting the boolean `availability-service`
property to `true` or `false` by means of the `asadmin set` subcommand.
The availability service is enabled by default for {productName}
clusters and all Web, EJB, and JMS containers running in a cluster.

The value set for the `availability-service` property is inherited by
all child objects running in a given cluster or container unless the
value is explicitly overridden at the individual module or application
level. For example, if the `availability-service` property is set to
`true` for an EJB container, the availability service will be enabled by
default for all EJB modules running in that container.

Conversely, to enable availability at a given scope, you must enable it
at all higher levels as well. For example, to enable availability at the
application level, you must also enable it at the cluster or server
instance and container levels.

==== To Enable Availability for a Cluster, Standalone Instance or Container

This procedure explains how to enable high availability for a cluster as
a whole, or for Web, EJB, or JMS containers that run in a cluster, or
for a standalone server instance that is not part of a cluster.

1. Create a {productName} cluster.
+
For more information, see xref:clusters.adoc#to-create-a-cluster[To Create a Cluster].

2. Set up load balancing for the cluster.
+
For instructions, see xref:http-load-balancing.adoc#setting-up-http-load-balancing[Setting Up HTTP Load Balancing].

3. Verify that the cluster and all instances within the cluster for
which you want to enable availability is running.
+
These steps are also necessary when enabling availability for a Web,
EJB, or JMS container running in a cluster. The cluster and all
instances in the cluster for which you want to enable availability must be running.
[arabic]
.. Verify that the cluster is running.
+
[source]
----
asadmin> list-clusters
----
A list of clusters and their status (running, not running) is displayed.
If the cluster for which you want to enable availability is not running,
you can start it with the following command:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> start-cluster cluster-name
----
.. Verify that all instances in the cluster are running.
+
[source]
----
asadmin> list-instances
----
A list of instances and their status is displayed. If the instances for
which you want to enable availability are not running, you can start
them by using the following command for each instance:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> start-instance instance-name
----

4. Use one of the following `asadmin` xref:reference-manual.adoc#set[`set`]
subcommands to enable availability for a specific cluster, or for a
specific Web, EJB, or JMS container.
* For a cluster as a whole
+
[source]
----
asadmin> set cluster-name-config.availability-service.availability-enabled=true
----
For example, for a cluster named `c1`:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> set c1-config.availability-service.availability-enabled=true
----
* For the Web container in a cluster
+
[source]
----
asadmin> set cluster-name-config.availability-service \
.web-container-availability.availability-enabled=true
----
* For the EJB container in a cluster
+
[source]
----
asadmin> set cluster-name-config.availability-service \
.ejb-container-availability.availability-enabled=true
----
* For the JMS container in a cluster
+
[source]
----
asadmin> set cluster-name-config.availability-service \
.jms-availability.availability-enabled=true
----
* For a standalone server instance (not part of a cluster)
+
[source]
----
asadmin> set instance-name-config.availability-service.availability-enabled=true
----

5. Restart the standalone server instance or each server instance in the cluster.

6. Enable availability for any SFSB that requires it.
+
Select methods for which checkpointing the session state is necessary.
For more information, see xref:#configuring-availability-for-an-individual-bean[Configuring Availability for an Individual Bean].

7. Make each web module distributable if you want it to be highly available.
+
For more information, see "xref:application-deployment-guide.adoc#web-module-deployment-guidelines[Web Module Deployment
Guidelines]" in {productName} Application Deployment Guide.

8. Enable availability for individual applications, web modules, or EJB
modules during deployment.

[[configuring-availability-for-individual-web-applications]]

==== Configuring Availability for Individual Web Applications

To enable and configure availability for an individual web application,
edit the application deployment descriptor file, `glassfish-web.xml`.
The settings in an application's deployment descriptor override the web
container's availability settings.

The `session-manager` element's `persistence-type` attribute determines
the type of session persistence an application uses. It must be set to
`replicated` to enable high availability session persistence.

[[example]]

===== Example

[source,xml]
----
<glassfish-web-app> ...
  <session-config>
    <session-manager persistence-type="replicated">
      <manager-properties>
        <property name="persistenceFrequency" value="web-method" />
      </manager-properties>
      <store-properties>
        <property name="persistenceScope" value="session" />
      </store-properties>
    </session-manager> ...
</session-config> ...

[[configuring-replication-and-multi-threaded-concurrent-access-to-httpsessions]]

==== Configuring Replication and Multi-Threaded Concurrent Access to `HttpSessions`

If you are using Memory Replication and your web application involves
multiple client threads concurrently accessing the same session ID, then
you may experience session loss even without any instance failure. The
problem is that the {productName} 7 memory replication framework
makes use of session versioning. This feature was designed with the more
traditional HTTP request/response communication model in mind.

However, for some types of applications, the traditional
request/response model does not work. Examples include many Ajax-related
frameworks and the use of Frames. Another example is when a page
includes many static resources, such as JPG files. In these situations,
most browsers will optimize the loading of these resources by using
multiple parallel connections, each of which is handled by a separate
request processing thread. If the application has already established a
session, then this will also involve more than one thread at a time
accessing a single `HttpSession`.

The solution in such cases is to use the `relaxVersionSemantics`
property in the `glassfish-web.xml` deployment descriptor file for the
application. This enables the web container to return for each
requesting thread whatever version of the session that is in the active
cache regardless of the version number. This is critical when multiple
threads are interacting in an essentially non-deterministic fashion with
the container.

[[example-1]]

===== Example

The following is an example snippet from a `glassfish-web.xml` file that
illustrates where to add the `relaxVersionSemantics` property.

[source,xml]
----
<glassfish-web-app>
  <session-config>
    <session-manager persistence-type="replicated">
      <manager-properties>
    <property name="relaxCacheVersionSemantics" value="true"/>
      </manager-properties>
    </session-manager>
  </session-config>

.....
</glassfish-web-app>

[[using-single-sign-on-with-session-failover]]

==== Using Single Sign-on with Session Failover

In a single application server instance, once a user is authenticated by
an application, the user is not required to re-authenticate individually
to other applications running on the same instance. This is called
single sign-on.

For this feature to continue to work even when an HTTP session fails
over to another instance in a cluster, single sign-on information must
be persisted using in-memory replication. To persist single sign-on
information, first, enable availability for the server instance and the
web container, then enable single-sign-on state failover.

You can enable single sign-on state failover by using the `asadmin set`
command to set the configuration's
`availability-service.web-container-availability.sso-failover-enabled`
property to true.

For example, use the `set` command as follows, where `config1` is the
configuration name:

[source]
----
asadmin> set config1.availability-service.web-container-availability. \
sso-failover-enabled="true"
----

[[single-sign-on-groups]]

===== Single Sign-On Groups

Applications that can be accessed through a single name and password
combination constitute a single sign-on group. For HTTP sessions
corresponding to applications that are part of a single sign-on group,
if one of the sessions times out, other sessions are not invalidated and
continue to be available. This is because time out of one session should
not affect the availability of other sessions.

As a corollary of this behavior, if a session times out and you try to
access the corresponding application from the same browser window that
was running the session, you are not required to authenticate again.
However, a new session is created.

Take the example of a shopping cart application that is a part of a
single sign-on group with two other applications. Assume that the
session time out value for the other two applications is higher than the
session time out value for the shopping cart application. If your
session for the shopping cart application times out and you try to run
the shopping cart application from the same browser window that was
running the session, you are not required to authenticate again.
However, the previous shopping cart is lost, and you have to create a
new shopping cart. The other two applications continue to run as usual
even though the session running the shopping cart application has timed
out.

Similarly, suppose a session corresponding to any of the other two
applications times out. You are not required to authenticate again while
connecting to the application from the same browser window in which you
were running the session.


[NOTE]
====
This behavior applies only to cases where the session times out. If
single sign-on is enabled and you invalidate one of the sessions using
`HttpSession.invalidate()`, the sessions for all applications belonging
to the single sign-on group are invalidated. If you try to access any
application belonging to the single sign-on group, you are required to
authenticate again, and a new session is created for the client
accessing the application.
====


[[using-coherenceweb-for-http-session-persistence]]

==== Using Coherence*Web for HTTP Session Persistence

Built on top of Oracle Coherence, Coherence*Web is an HTTP session
management module dedicated to managing session state in clustered
environments. Starting with Coherence 3.7 and {productName} 7,
there is a new feature of Coherence*Web called ActiveCache for
GlassFish. ActiveCache for GlassFish provides Coherence*Web
functionality in web applications deployed on {productName}s. Within
{productName}, Coherence*Web functions as an additional web container
persistence type, named `coherence-web`.

For information about how to configure and deploy Coherence*Web on
{productName}, see
http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E18686_01/coh.37/e18690/glassfish.html[Using
Coherence*Web with {productName}]
(`http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18686_01/coh.37/e18690/glassfish.html`).

[[stateful-session-bean-failover]]

=== Stateful Session Bean Failover

Stateful session beans (SFSBs) contain client-specific state. There is a
one-to-one relationship between clients and the stateful session beans.
At creation, the EJB container gives each SFSB a unique session ID that
binds it to a client.

An SFSB's state can be saved in a persistent store in case a server
instance fails. The state of an SFSB is saved to the persistent store at
predefined points in its life cycle. This is called

checkpointing. If enabled, checkpointing generally occurs after the bean
completes any transaction, even if the transaction rolls back.

However, if an SFSB participates in a bean-managed transaction, the
transaction might be committed in the middle of the execution of a bean
method. Since the bean's state might be undergoing transition as a
result of the method invocation, this is not an appropriate time to
checkpoint the bean's state. In this case, the EJB container checkpoints
the bean's state at the end of the corresponding method, provided the
bean is not in the scope of another transaction when that method ends.
If a bean-managed transaction spans across multiple methods,
checkpointing is delayed until there is no active transaction at the end
of a subsequent method.

The state of an SFSB is not necessarily transactional and might be
significantly modified as a result of non-transactional business
methods. If this is the case for an SFSB, you can specify a list of
checkpointed methods, as described in xref:#specifying-methods-to-be-checkpointed[Specifying Methods to
Be Checkpointed]

If a distributable web application references an SFSB, and the web
application's session fails over, the EJB reference is also failed over.

If an SFSB that uses session persistence is undeployed while the
{productName} instance is stopped, the session data in the
persistence store might not be cleared. To prevent this, undeploy the
SFSB while the {productName} instance is running.

[[configuring-availability-for-the-ejb-container]]

==== Configuring Availability for the EJB Container

To enable availability for the EJB container use the `asadmin set`
command to set the following three properties for the configuration:

* `availability-service.ejb-container-availability.availability-enabled`
* `availability-service.ejb-container-availability.sfsb-persistence-type`
* `availability-service.ejb-container-availability.sfsb-ha-persistence-type`

For example, if `config1` is the configuration name, use the following
commands:

[source]
----
asadmin> set --user admin --passwordfile password.txt
--host localhost
--port 4849
config1.availability-service.
ejb-container-availability.availability-enabled="true"

asadmin> set --user admin --passwordfile password.txt --host localhost --port
4849
config1.availability-service.
ejb-container-availability.sfsb-persistence-type="file"
asadmin> set --user admin --passwordfile password.txt
--host localhost
--port 4849
config1.availability-service.
ejb-container-availability.sfsb-ha-persistence-type="replicated"
----

[[configuring-the-sfsb-session-store-when-availability-is-disabled]]

===== Configuring the SFSB Session Store When Availability Is Disabled

If availability is disabled, the local file system is used for SFSB
state passivation, but not persistence. To change where the SFSB state
is stored, change the Session Store Location setting in the EJB
container. For information about configuring store properties, see the
Administration Console online help.

[[configuring-availability-for-an-individual-application-or-ejb-module]]

==== Configuring Availability for an Individual Application or EJB Module

You can enable SFSB availability for an individual application or EJB
module during deployment:

* If you are deploying with the Administration Console, check the
Availability Enabled checkbox.
* If you are deploying using use the `asadmin deploy` or
`asadmin deploydir` commands, set the `--availabilityenabled` option to
`true`. For more information, see xref:reference-manual.adoc#deploy[`deploy`(1)] and
xref:reference-manual.adoc#deploydir[`deploydir`(1)].

[[configuring-availability-for-an-individual-bean]]

==== Configuring Availability for an Individual Bean

To enable availability and select methods to be checkpointed for an
individual SFSB, use the `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` deployment descriptor
file.

To enable high availability session persistence, set
`availability-enabled="true"` in the `ejb` element.

----

[[specifying-methods-to-be-checkpointed]]

==== Specifying Methods to Be Checkpointed

If enabled, checkpointing generally occurs after the bean completes any
transaction, even if the transaction rolls back. To specify additional
optional checkpointing of SFSBs at the end of non-transactional business
methods that cause important modifications to the bean's state, use the
`checkpoint-at-end-of-method` element in the `ejb` element of the
`glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` deployment descriptor file.

The non-transactional methods in the `checkpoint-at-end-of-method`
element can be:

* `create()` methods defined in the home interface of the SFSB, if you
want to checkpoint the initial state of the SFSB immediately after
creation
* For SFSBs using container managed transactions only, methods in the
remote interface of the bean marked with the transaction attribute
`TX_NOT_SUPPORTED` or `TX_NEVER`
* For SFSBs using bean managed transactions only, methods in which a
bean managed transaction is neither started nor committed
+
Any other methods mentioned in this list are ignored. At the end of
invocation of each of these methods, the EJB container saves the state
of the SFSB to persistent store.


[NOTE]
====
If an SFSB does not participate in any transaction, and if none of its
methods are explicitly specified in the `checkpoint-at-end-of-method`
element, the bean's state is not checkpointed at all even if
`availability-enabled="true"` for this bean.

For better performance, specify a small subset of methods. The methods
should accomplish a significant amount of work or result in important
modification to the bean's state.
