You get this for free among Solaris DHCP servers if NIS+ is selected as the
datastore for dhcp data.

Yes and No...

Yes:
For the current version of the JavaStation (mr coffee), mac addresses are
"bolted" to the IP addresses for each JavaSTation (this is because
rarp/bootparams are used by the PROM  and the standalone boot program to
locate and download the JavaOS, and DHCP has been hardwired to return the
same address as in.rarpd). So, you can make the same MAC address to IP
address mappings in the NT server's database and the Solaris Server's dhcp
network tables. In the Solaris server's dhcp network tables, the "server
ip" field has the affect that if the Solaris server's ip address is listed,
it'll respond immediately. If the NT server's address is there, the Solaris
server will consider the address "owned" by the NT server, and will let the
NT server get first crack at serving the client. If the client is still
requesting an address after 10 seconds, the Solaris server will respond.
The key is to configure both servers to return the same address for a
given mac address, and to return the same "payload" of configuration
parameters.

No:
For the next instance of the JavaStation (Krups) and standard DHCP clients like
Solaris, NT, Windows95, etc, one IP address good as another. Thus, You don't
want to "bolt" a mac address to an IP address - you'd like to let the DHCP
server and client to "work it out" as to which IP address a specific client
gets. In this case, it's best to divide the IP address ranges between servers.
This is to prevent the situation where both servers have allocated an IP
address to the same client (not the same IP address) due to one or the other
servers being unavailable during the time a client's lease expires.

There's answerbook docs in 2.6, as well as the manual pages: dhcp, in.dhcpd,
dhcptab, dhcp_network.

Before you start hacking up your DHCP configuration, you really should find
out what the "real" problem is. As I said above, that quote doesn't give
any information. From this mail, there isn't a DHCP bug at all: it's just that
some vendor's portmapper implementation running on the NT boxes is responding
inappropriately.
