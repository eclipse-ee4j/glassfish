<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eclipse GlassFish Server requires JDK release 6. The minimum
(and certified) version of the JDK that is required for GlassFish Server
Open Source Edition depends on the operating system:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For supported operating systems except Mac OS, the minimum required
version is 1.6.0_17.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Mac OS X operating system, the minimum required version is
1.6.0_15.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If necessary, download and install the required JDK software.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also ensure that the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable on your system
points to the JDK installation directory and not the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) software.</p>

<h4 id="_examining_log_files">Examining Log Files</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Logging is one of your most important troubleshooting tools. It is the
process by which Eclipse GlassFish Server captures data
about events that occur during server operation, such as configuration
errors, security failures, or server malfunction. This data is recorded
in log files, and is usually your first source of information when
Enterprise Server problems occur. The primary purpose of log files is to
provide troubleshooting information. Analyzing the log files can help
determine the health of the server and identify problem areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, log information for each GlassFish Server Open Source
Edition server instance is captured in a <code>server.log</code> file. That is,
each instance, including the domain administration server (DAS), has an
individual log file. By default, the log file for the DAS is located in
domain-dir`/logs`, and the log file for each instance is located in
instance-dir`/logs`.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, for domains that use clustering, GlassFish Server Open
Source Edition captures log information for each cluster instance in a
<code>cluster.log</code> file. By default, the <code>cluster.log</code> file is also located
in instance-dir`/logs`.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oracle recommends using the Administration Console to view logging
information. However, you can open a log file in a text editor and
search for the module or message in which you are interested. GlassFish
Server Open Source Edition also lets you collect log files into a ZIP
file, which provides a convenient means to collect and view the log
files for an instance or a domain even when it is not running.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You configure the Logging Service by setting attributes in the
<code>logging.properties</code> file. Each server, configuration, instance, and
cluster in the Eclipse GlassFish Server domain has an
individual <code>logging.properties</code> file. The root directory in which these
<code>logging.properties</code> files are located is the same directory as for the
<code>domain.xml</code> file, typically domain-dir/<code>config</code>. The default target
when configuring logging attributes is the DAS. However, you can
optionally target a specific server, instance, or cluster. You can also
target a configuration that is shared by one or more instances or
clusters. The Logging Service can also be configured using the
Administration Console.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Log levels such as <code>SEVERE</code>, <code>WARNING</code>, <code>INFO</code>, <code>CONFIG</code>, and others can
be set to provide different types and amounts of information. The
default setting is <code>INFO</code>. Each Eclipse GlassFish Server
module has its own logger, and each logger has its own namespace. Log
levels can be set globally for all loggers, or individually for
module-specific loggers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For information about using the Administration Console log viewer and
logging functions, see the Administration Console online help. For
information about using the command line for logging functions, see

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Monitoring is another helpful tool. It is the process of reviewing the
statistics of a system to improve performance or solve problems. By
monitoring the state of various components and services deployed in
Eclipse GlassFish Server you can identify performance
bottlenecks, predict failures, perform root cause analysis, and ensure
that everything is functioning as expected. For more information about
monitoring, including JConsole information, see

generate and analyze a thread dump.</p>

<p>VisualVM is a Java troubleshooting tool that uses various technologies
such as <code>jvmstat</code>, JMX, and Attach API to access monitored applications.
VisualVM is a tool for visualizing data sources and by default
visualizes the following types: applications, hosts, snapshots, core
dumps, heap dumps, and thread dumps. These data sources are visualized
in VisualVM so that they can be monitored for the purposes of analysis,
management, and troubleshooting. VisualVM is commonly used to detect
memory leaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>VisualVM has a GlassFish plugin that enhances monitoring of hosted
applications by adding specialized overview, a tab for monitoring the
HTTP Service, and the ability to visually select and monitor any of the
deployed web applications. You can experiment with VisualVM
troubleshooting capabilities, but note that various features depend on
the Java versions used in the client and server. Depending on your
configuration, you might only get parts of the VisualVM features. For
