Capturing information on {productName} runtime events

=== Description

Logging is the process by which {productName} captures data about
events that occur during {productName} operation. {productName}
components and application components generate logging data, which is
saved in the server log, typically domain-dir`/logs/server.log`. The
server log is the first source of information if {productName}
problems occur.

The server log is rotated when the file reaches the specified size in
bytes, or the specified time has elapsed. The file can also be rotated
manually by using the `rotate-log` subcommand.

In addition to the server log, the domain-dir``/logs`` directory contains
two other kinds of logs:

* HTTP service access logs, located in the `/access` subdirectory
* Transaction service logs, located in the `/tx` subdirectory

Logging levels can be configured by using the Administration Console or
the `set-log-levels` subcommand. Additional properties can be set by
using the Administration Console or by editing the `logging.properties`
file. The default `logging.properties` file is typically located in
domain-dir``/config``.

Although application components can use the Apache Commons Logging
Library to record messages, the platform standard JSR 047 API is
recommended for better log configuration.
