Hi Team,

I created the 1.2.1 mws for TAP patches, called TAP_PATCHES.

This workspace is for *PATCHES ONLY*.  This means putbacks should be
done only for official CTE patches.

Bug fixes which are not official CTE patches *SHOULD NOT* be putback
here.

For those who didn't see this before: This workspace 
includes the last 2 patches which didn't get included in 2.6 Solaris.
So they correspond to 1.2_fcs_i rather than 1.2_fcs_g.  This is to
save people the trouble of putting back what has already been putback.
Actually the 1.2_fcs_i patch (dtterm fo Japan) has already been made
into an official patch, and John McKernan assures me that any patch
made with the 1.2_fcs_h patch (Motif - XmGetPostedFromWidget() returns
wrong widget) could only be better for it, if it's not the next.

It's going to be a while before I have new automount maps created,
tested, and pushed by ENS.   So for a while you won't be able to use
the familiar /scde/mws directory.  It's in:

/net/meatball/cde_stuff/TAP_PATCHES

It's better to use /net addresses for your parent directory, rather
than /scde/mws anyway.  That way if there's net problems with /scde
as we had a couple months ago, you won't be stuck.

Please let me know if you have any problems/questions.

Marty
