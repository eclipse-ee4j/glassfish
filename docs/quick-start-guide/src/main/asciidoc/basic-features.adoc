[[starting-and-stopping-the-default-domain]]

=== Starting and Stopping the Default Domain

When you install {productName}, a default domain named `domain1` is
created. The following procedures describe how to start and stop
`domain1` when it is the only domain. For information about starting and
stopping a domain when there are multiple domains, see
"xref:administration-guide.adoc#administering-domains[Administering Domains]" in {productName} Administration Guide.

[[to-start-the-default-domain]]

[[high-availability-clustering-and-load-balancing]]

=== High Availability Clustering and Load Balancing

{productName} enables multiple {productName} instances to be
clustered to provide high availability through failure protection,
scalability, and load balancing. The subsections that follow provide an
overview of high availability clustering and load balancing for
{productName}.

[[clusters-of-glassfish-server-instances]]

==== Clusters of {productName} Instances

A cluster is a collection of {productName} instances that work
together as one logical entity. A cluster provides a runtime environment
for one or more Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Jakarta EE)
applications. A cluster provides high availability through failure
protection, scalability, and load balancing.

A {productName} instance is a single Virtual Machine for the Java
platform (Java Virtual Machine or JVM machine) on a single node in which
{productName} is running. A node defines the host where the {productName} instance resides. The JVM machine must be compatible with the
Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Jakarta EE).

{productName} instances form the basis of an application deployment.
An instance is a building block in the clustering, load balancing, and
session persistence features of {productName}. Each instance belongs
to a single domain and has its own directory structure, configuration,
and deployed applications. Every instance contains a reference to a node
that defines the host where the instance resides.

For more information, see the following documentation:

* "xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#administering-glassfish-server-nodes[Administering {productName} Nodes]" in {productName} High Availability Administration Guide
* "xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#administering-glassfish-server-clusters[Administering {productName} Clusters]" in
{productName} High Availability Administration Guide
* "xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#administering-glassfish-server-instances[Administering {productName} Instances]" in
{productName} High Availability Administration Guide

[[session-persistence-and-failover]]

==== Session Persistence and Failover

Storing session state data enables the session state to be recovered
after the failover of an instance in a cluster. Recovering the session
state enables the session to continue without loss of information.
{productName} supports in-memory session replication on other servers
in the cluster for maintaining HTTP session and stateful session bean data.

For more information, see "xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#configuring-high-availability-session-persistence-and-failover[Configuring High
Availability Session Persistence and Failover]" in {productName} High Availability Administration Guide.

[[load-balancing-for-clustered-configurations]]

==== Load Balancing for Clustered Configurations

{productName} supports web server and hardware-based load balancing
for clustered configurations. A load balancer is deployed with a
cluster, and provides the following features:

* Allows an application or service to be scaled horizontally across
multiple physical (or logical) hosts yet still present the user with a single URL
* Insulates the user from host failures or server crashes when used with
session persistence
* Enhances security by hiding the internal network from the user

{productName} is compatible with the Apache HTTP
server `mod_jk` module for load balancing.

{productName} load balancing configurations can vary widely depending
on the needs of your enterprise. For complete information about
configuring load balancing in {productName}, see the following
documentation:

* "xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#configuring-http-load-balancing[
Configuring HTTP Load Balancing]" in
{productName} High Availability Administration Guide
* "xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#rmi-iiop-load-balancing-and-failover[
