= Enabling Centralized Administration of {productName} Instances

[[enabling-centralized-administration-of-glassfish-server-instances]]
== 2 Enabling Centralized Administration of {productName} Instances

{productName} uses the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)
remote protocol or secure shell (SSH) to ensure that clusters that span
multiple hosts can be administered centrally. To perform administrative
operations on {productName} instances that are remote from the domain
administration server (DAS), the DAS must be able to communicate with
those instances. If an instance is running, the DAS connects to the
running instance directly. For example, when you deploy an application
to an instance, the DAS connects to the instance and deploys the
application to the instance.

However, the DAS cannot connect to an instance to perform operations on
an instance that is not running, such as creating or starting the
instance. For these operations, the DAS uses DCOM or SSH to contact a
remote host and administer instances there. DCOM or SSH provides
confidentiality and security for data that is exchanged between the DAS
and remote hosts.


[NOTE]
====
The use of DCOM or SSH to enable centralized administration of remote
instances is optional. If the use of DCOM or SSH is not feasible in your
environment, you can administer remote instances locally.

[[about-centralized-administration-of-glassfish-server-instances]]

=== About Centralized Administration of {productName} Instances

The use of DCOM or SSH to enable centralized administration of remote
instances is optional and is required only for specific operations.
Instances local to the DAS can be administered without DCOM or SSH. If
DCOM or SSH is not practicable in your environment, you can administer
remote instances locally.

[[determining-whether-to-enable-centralized-administration]]
==== Determining Whether to Enable Centralized Administration

Before setting up a {productName} cluster, use the following
considerations to determine whether to enable centralized administration
of remote instances:

* If you are planning a large cluster of many instances, consider
enabling centralized administration of instances in the cluster.
Centralized administration of instances simplifies the administration of
the cluster by enabling you to perform all administrative operations on
the cluster and its instances from the DAS.
* If you are planning a small cluster of few instances, consider whether
enabling centralized administration requires more effort than logging in
to individual hosts to administer remote instances locally.

How you administer instances and the nodes on which they resides varies
depending on whether and how centralized administration is enabled. The
following table provides cross-references to instructions for
administering nodes and instances depending on the protocol that is used
for enabling centralized administration, if any.

[[considerations-for-using-dcom-for-centralized-administration]]
==== Considerations for Using DCOM for Centralized Administration

DCOM enables communications between Windows hosts. In a typical
{productName} deployment, the DAS acts as a DCOM client, and hosts
where instances reside act as DCOM servers. To create or start an
instance on a remote host, the DAS instructs the DCOM server on the host
to start the `asadmin` utility of {productName}. The `asadmin`
utility then performs the required operation on the host to create or
start the instance.

The DCOM service must be running on hosts where instances reside, but is
not required to be running on the DAS host. The DAS uses its own DCOM
client for communicating with hosts where instances reside. On Windows
hosts, the DCOM server is typically running by default as a Windows Service.

DCOM is available only with the Windows operating system. Because DCOM
is typically installed and preconfigured, minimal additional setup is
required to use DCOM with {productName}.

Before setting up DCOM, decide which Windows user {productName} will
use when connecting to remote hosts. For the following reasons,
administration is simplest if the Windows user is the user that starts the DAS:

* Remote instances are started as the Windows user.
* By default, the DAS assumes that the Windows user is the user that is running the DAS.


[[considerations-for-using-ssh-for-centralized-administration]]
==== Considerations for Using SSH for Centralized Administration

In a typical {productName} deployment, the DAS acts as the SSH
client, and hosts where instances reside act as SSH servers. The SSH
Server Daemon `sshd` must be running on hosts where instances reside,
but is not required to be running on the DAS host. The DAS uses its own
SSH client for communicating with hosts where instances reside. However,
to generate keys and test SSH setup, a native SSH client must be
installed on the DAS host.

The requirements for SSH configuration and user management are different
for each operating system on which {productName} is supported.
Therefore, the use of SSH for centralized administration involves using
SSH tools to configure SSH on the operating system that you are using.

On UNIX and Linux systems, SSH is typically installed and preconfigured,
and requires minimal additional setup. On Windows systems, additional
setup is required to install and configure an SSH provider.

[[obtaining-ssh-software]]

===== Obtaining SSH Software

On UNIX and Linux systems, SSH software is typically installed as part
of the base operating system.

However, on Windows systems, you must install one of the following SSH providers:

* http://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin] (`http://www.cygwin.com/`) release 1.7.6
* http://www.mkssoftware.com[MKS Toolkit for Developers]
 (`http://www.mkssoftware.com`) release 9.2

[[determining-the-ssh-user]]

===== Determining the SSH User

Before setting up SSH, decide which SSH user {productName} will use
when connecting to remote hosts. For the following reasons,
administration is simplest if the SSH user is the user that starts the
DAS:

* For public key authentication, the user that starts the DAS must be
able to read the SSH user's private key file.
* Remote instances are started as the SSH user.
* By default, the DAS assumes that the SSH user is the user that is
running the DAS.

[[requirements-for-the-ssh-users-environment]]

===== Requirements for the SSH User's Environment

The environment of the SSH user on any remote host to which the user
will connect must meet the requirements that are stated in
"xref:release-notes.adoc#paths-and-environment-settings-for-the-jdk-software[Paths and Environment Settings for the JDK Software]"
in {productName} Release Notes.

The SSH user's environment on a host is set by the environment set-up
files that are run when the user uses SSH to run a command on the host.
You must ensure that these files set up the SSH user's environment
correctly.

The files that are run when the user uses SSH to run a command are
different than the files that are run when the user logs in to a host.
For example, in the bash shell, `.profile` and `.bashrc` are run when
the user logs in, but only `.bashrc` is run when the user runs a
command. Therefore, in the bash shell, you must ensure that `.bashrc`
contains the required environment settings for the SSH user.

[[file-access-permissions-on-uac-enabled-windows-systems]]

===== File Access Permissions on UAC-Enabled Windows Systems


[NOTE]
====
The http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709691%28WS.10%29.aspx[User
Account Control (UAC)](`http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709691%28WS.10%29.aspx`)
feature is available only on some versions of the Windows operating
system, for example, Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows 2008.
====


You might be using a UAC-enabled Windows system and choose to store
files for {productName} instances in a directory other than the SSH
user's home directory. In this situation, the SSH user must have native
(that is, nonvirtual) read and write access to the file system where the
instances are to be stored. The OS-level administrator has such access
by default. You can also configure the system to grant such access to
other users. For more information, see the documentation for the Windows
operating system.

[[setting-up-dcom-and-testing-the-dcom-set-up]]

=== Setting Up DCOM and Testing the DCOM Set Up

Setting up DCOM on a host involves the following tasks:

* Verifying Windows operating system settings for the host
* Enabling the Windows user to run scripts on the host
* Setting up password authentication for the Windows user on the host

Set up DCOM on all hosts where instances in your cluster will reside.

After setting up DCOM on a host, test the connection over DCOM to the
host.

[[windows-operating-system-settings]]

==== Windows Operating System Settings

To enable access to a host over DCOM, ensure that the following items in
the Windows operating system are set as follows on the host:

* The following services are in the started state and are set to start automatically:

** Server
** Remote Registry

* Network Access: Sharing security model for local accounts is set to Classic.
* The following ports are open:

** DCOM port 135 or 139
** Windows Shares port 445

[[to-enable-the-windows-user-to-run-scripts-on-a-remote-host]]

==== To Enable the Windows User to Run Scripts on a Remote Host

To run scripts on a remote host, full control over the following Windows
registry keys must be allowed for the Windows user or the group that
contains the Windows user:

* One of the following keys, depending on the processor architecture of the host:

** 32-bit architecture: +
   HKEY_LOCAl_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Wow6432Node\CLSID\\{76A64158-CB41-11D1-8B02-00600806D9B6}
** 64-bit architecture: +
   HKEY_LOCAl_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\\{76A64158-CB41-11D1-8B02-00600806D9B6}

* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\\{72C24DD5-D70A-438B-8A42-98424B88AFB8}

In some versions of Windows, only the user `NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller`
has full control over these Windows registry keys. If your version of
Windows is configured in this way, you must modify these keys to allow
full control over them for the Windows user or the group that contains
the Windows user.


[NOTE]
====
Only the operating-system-level administrator user can edit the Windows registry.
====


Perform this procedure for each Windows registry key that you are
modifying on each host where instances in your cluster will reside.

1. If necessary, start the Registry Editor.
+
[source]
----
regedit.exe
----
The Registry Editor window opens.

2. In the Registry Editor window, navigate to the registry key that you are modifying.

3. Select the key, click mouse button 3, and from the pop-up menu that
opens, select Permissions.
+
The Permissions window for the key opens.

4. Determine whether full control is allowed for the Windows user or
the group that contains the Windows user.
* If full control is allowed, no further action is required.
* If full control is not allowed, allow full control as follows:
[arabic]
.. In the Permissions window, click Advanced. +
The Advanced Security Settings window for the key opens.
.. In the Advanced Security Settings window, select the Owner tab.
.. From the Change owner to list, select the Windows user or the group
that contains the Windows user.
.. Ensure that the Replace owner on subcontainer and objects option is selected.
.. Click Apply, then OK. +
The Advanced Security Settings window closes. The Permissions window
shows that full control is allowed for the Windows user or the group
that contains the Windows user.

.. In the Permissions window, click OK. The Permissions window closes.

5. After modifying all the Windows registry keys over which full
control is required, quit the Registry Editor.

[[to-test-the-connection-over-dcom-to-a-remote-host]]

==== To Test the Connection Over DCOM to a Remote Host

Testing the connection over DCOM to a remote host verifies that the
required Windows services are running, the required ports are open, and
the Windows user has a valid user account on the host.

Before attempting to perform any task that the requires the DAS contact
the DCOM server on a remote host, test the connection over DCOM to the
host. If this test fails, any attempt to perform a task that the
requires the DAS contact the DCOM server on the host will also fail.
Examples of such tasks are creating a DCOM node to represent the host or
creating an instance that resides on the host. For more information, see
xref:nodes.adoc#to-create-a-dcom-node[To Create a `DCOM` Node] and
xref:instances.adoc#to-create-an-instance-centrally[To Create an Instance Centrally].

If you cannot connect to the host over DCOM, troubleshoot the DCOM setup
before proceeding.

Before You Begin

Ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

* The Windows user is a valid user on the host to which you are testing
the connection over DCOM.
* Items in the Windows operating system are set on the host as described

==== To Download and Install Cygwin

For centralized {productName} administration, a basic Cygwin
installation that includes the SSH client and the SSH server daemon
`sshd` is sufficient. The default installation options are sufficient to
create such a basic installation.

1. Log in as a user with Administrator privileges.

2. Create the folder `C:\cygwin`.

3. From the http://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin home page]
(`http://www.cygwin.com/`), download and save the `setup.exe` file to your desktop.

4. Run the `setup.exe` file.

5. Select the default for the following options:

* The `bin` directory of the JDK software

[[to-set-the-home-directory-for-the-cygwin-ssh-user]]

==== To Set the Home Directory for the Cygwin SSH User

The SSH Server Daemon `sshd` locates a user's home directory from the
configuration in the user database, not from environment variables such
as `HOME`. To ensure that all {productName} commands can run without
errors, each SSH user must be configured to have a home directory.

Each user on a Windows host where SSH is set up potentially has two home
directories:

* Windows home directory. {productName} commands, which are run in a
Windows command window, use the Windows home directory.
* SSH home directory. SSH commands, which are run in a shell such as
`bash` or `ksh`, use the SSH home directory.

If these home directories are different, {productName} and SSH each
locate a user's `.ssh` directory in different directories. To simplify
the set up of SSH, configure each user's home directory for SSH and
Windows to be the same directory. A disadvantage of this approach is
that the SSH home directory has spaces in its path name. Spaces in path
names are cumbersome in the UNIX environment.

1. Log in as a user with Administrator privileges.
2. In the `c:\cygwin\etc\passwd` file, edit the home directory setting
for the SSH user to specify the user's home directory for Windows.

[[to-configure-and-start-the-cygwin-ssh-server-daemon-sshd]]

==== To Configure and Start the Cygwin SSH Server Daemon `sshd`

Before You Begin

Ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

* A user account is created for each user that will log in to the host through SSH.
* A password is set for each user account.

The SSH server daemon `sshd` disallows authentication of any user for
whose account a password is not set.

1. Double-click the Cygwin icon. A Cygwin terminal is started.

2. If necessary, set the password for your user account.
[arabic]
.. Run the `passwd` command as follows:

The SSH Server Daemon `sshd` locates a user's home directory from the
configuration in the user database, not from environment variables such
as `HOME`. To ensure that all {productName} commands can run without
errors, each SSH user must be configured to have a home directory.

Each user on a Windows host where SSH is set up potentially has two home
directories:

* Windows home directory. {productName} commands, which are run in a
Windows command window, use the Windows home directory.
* SSH home directory. SSH commands, which are run in a shell such as
`bash` or `ksh`, use the SSH home directory.

If these home directories are different, {productName} and SSH each
locate a user's `.ssh` directory in different directories. To simplify
the set up of SSH, configure each user's home directory for SSH and
Windows to be the same directory. A disadvantage of this approach is
that the SSH home directory has spaces in its path name. Spaces in path
names are cumbersome in the UNIX environment.

[[setting-up-ssh-on-unix-and-linux-systems]]

=== Setting Up SSH on UNIX and Linux Systems

Setting up SSH on UNIX and Linux systems involves verifying that the SSH
server daemon `sshd` is running and, if necessary, starting this daemon.
Set up SSH on the DAS host and on all hosts where instances in your
cluster will reside.

On UNIX and Linux systems, SSH software is typically installed as part
of the base operating system. If SSH is not installed, download and
install the appropriate http://www.openssh.com/[OpenSSH]
(`http://www.openssh.com/`) SSH package for your operating system.

How to set up SSH on UNIX and Linux systems depends on the flavor of the
operating system that you are running, as explained in the following
sections:

* xref:#to-set-up-ssh-on-oracle-solaris-systems[To Set Up SSH on Oracle Solaris Systems]
* xref:#to-set-up-ssh-on-macos-systems[To Set Up SSH on MacOS Systems]

[[testing-the-ssh-setup-on-a-host]]

=== Testing the SSH Setup on a Host

After setting up SSH on a host, test the setup to ensure that you can
use SSH to contact the host from another host. Testing the SSH setup on
a host verifies that the SSH server daemon `sshd` is running and that
the SSH user has a valid user account on the host.

If you cannot use SSH to contact the host, troubleshoot the SSH setup
before setting up SSH user authentication.

[[to-test-the-ssh-setup-on-a-host]]

If this step succeeds, your setup of SSH is complete.
+
The first time that you connect to a host, you might be warned that the
authenticity cannot be established and be asked if you want to continue
connection. If you trust the host, answer `yes` to connect to the host.

[[GSHAG330]]

Troubleshooting

To obtain diagnostic information, use the `-v` option of the
command-line SSH client and the `-d` option of the SSH server daemon
`sshd`. How to start the SSH server daemon `sshd` manually depends on
the operating system and SSH provider that you are using.

If the SSH server daemon `sshd` is set up on a host that has a firewall,
ensure that a rule is defined to allow inbound traffic on the SSH port.
The default SSH port is port 22.

If your connection is refused, the SSH server daemon `sshd` is not
running and you must start the daemon. For instructions, see the
following sections:

* xref:#to-configure-and-start-the-cygwin-ssh-server-daemon-sshd[To Configure and Start the Cygwin SSH Server Daemon `sshd`]
* xref:#to-configure-and-start-the-mks-toolkit-ssh-server-daemon-sshd[To Configure and Start the MKS Toolkit SSH Server Daemon `sshd`]
* xref:#to-set-up-ssh-on-oracle-solaris-systems[To Set Up SSH on Oracle Solaris Systems]

If your connection is accepted, but you cannot log in, ensure that the
SSH user has a valid user account on the host.

[[GSHAG331]]

Next Steps

After testing the SSH setup, set up SSH user authentication to enable
SSH to authenticate users without prompting for a password. For more
information, see xref:#setting-up-ssh-user-authentication[Setting Up SSH User Authentication].

[[setting-up-ssh-user-authentication]]

=== Setting Up SSH User Authentication

When a {productName} subcommand uses SSH to log in to a remote host,
{productName} must be able to authenticate the SSH user. Setting up
SSH user authentication ensures that this requirement is met.

Before setting up SSH user authentication, determine the authentication
scheme to use. If SSH is already deployed at your site, the
authentication scheme to use might already be chosen for you.

The following table lists the authentication schemes that {productName} supports. The table also lists the advantages and disadvantages
of each authentication scheme.

[width="100%",cols="<34%,<33%,<33%",options="header",]
|===
|Authentication Scheme |Advantages |Disadvantages
|Public key without encryption |{productName} provides tools to
simplify set up. |SSH must be configured to locate users' key files in
the correct location. File access permissions for key files and the
directory that contains the key files must be set correctly.

|Public key with passphrase-protected encryption |This scheme is more
secure than public key authentication without encryption. |SSH must be
configured to locate users' key files in the correct location. File
access permissions for key files and the directory that contains the key
files must be set correctly. For each SSH user, {productName}
password aliases are required for the encryption passphrase.

|Password |No SSH configuration is required to locate key files or to
ensure that file access permissions are correct. |For each SSH user,
{productName} password aliases are required for the SSH password.

[[to-set-up-public-key-authentication-without-encryption]]

==== To Set Up Public Key Authentication Without Encryption

Use the `setup-ssh` subcommand in local mode to set up public key
authentication without encryption. This subcommand enables you to set up
public key authentication on multiple hosts in a single operation.

The `setup-ssh` subcommand generates a key pair and distributes the
public key file to specified hosts. The private key file and the public
key file are protected only by the file system's file access
permissions. If you require additional security, set up public key
authentication with passphrase-protected encryption as explained in
xref:#to-set-up-encrypted-public-key-authentication[To Set Up Encrypted Public Key Authentication].

Before You Begin

Ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

* SSH is set up on each host where you are setting up public key
authentication. For more information, see the following sections:

** xref:#setting-up-cygwin-ssh-on-windows[Setting Up Cygwin SSH on Windows]
** xref:#setting-up-the-mks-toolkit-on-windows[Setting Up the MKS Toolkit on Windows]
** xref:#setting-up-ssh-on-unix-and-linux-systems[Setting Up SSH on UNIX and Linux Systems]

* Only the SSH user has write access to the following files and
directories on each host where you are setting up public key
authentication:

** The SSH user's home directory
** The `~/.ssh` directory
** The `authorized_key` file
+
If other users can write to these files and directories, the secure
service might not trust the `authorized_key` file and might disallow
public key authentication.


1. Generate an SSH key pair and distribute the public key file to the
hosts where you are setting up public key authentication.
+
[NOTE]
====
Only the options that are required to complete this task are provided in
this step. For information about all the options for setting up an SSH
key, see the xref:reference-manual.adoc#setup-ssh[`setup-ssh`(1)] help page.

Successfully connected to gfuser@sua02 using keyfile /home/gfuser/.ssh/id_rsa
Command setup-ssh executed successfully.
----

[[GSHAG333]]

Next Steps

After setting up public key authentication, test the setup by using
`ssh` to log in as the SSH user to each host where the public key was
distributed. For each host, log in first with the unqualified host name
and then with the fully qualified name. If SSH does not prompt for
password, public key authentication is set up correctly on the host.

If you are prompted for a password, verify that the public key file was
copied correctly to the SSH user's `authorized_keys` file.

[[GSHAG334]]

Troubleshooting

Setup might fail because file access permissions in the SSH user's home
directory are too permissive. In this situation, ensure that the file
access permissions in the SSH user's home directory meet the
requirements for performing this procedure.

If you have set the file access permissions in the SSH user's home
directory correctly, setup might still fail if you are using the MKS
Toolkit. In this situation, correct the problem in one of the following
ways:

* On each remote host, copy the public key file to the SSH user's
`~/.ssh` directory and import the file. To import the file, select the
Secure Service tab in the MKS configuration GUI and click Passwordless.
* Disable strict modes.

[[to-set-up-encrypted-public-key-authentication]]

==== To Set Up Encrypted Public Key Authentication

Encrypted key file authentication uses an encrypted private key file
that is protected with a passphrase. This passphrase must be provided to
use the private key to unlock the public key. If you require encrypted
public key authentication, you must use the SSH utility `ssh-keygen` to
generate an SSH key pair with an encrypted private key. You can then use
the `setup-ssh` subcommand to distribute the public key file to
specified hosts.

To use the encrypted key file, {productName} requires the passphrase
with which the key file was encrypted. To provide this passphrase
securely to {productName}, create a {productName} password alias
to represent the passphrase and store this alias in a password file that
is passed to the xref:reference-manual.adoc#asadmin[`asadmin`] utility.

If you have set the file access permissions in the SSH user's home
directory correctly, setup might still fail if you are using the MKS
Toolkit. In this situation, correct the problem in one of the following
ways:

* On each remote host, copy the public key file to the SSH user's
`~/.ssh` directory and import the file. To import the file, select the
Secure Service tab in the MKS configuration GUI and click Passwordless.
* Disable strict modes.

=== Installing and Removing {productName} Software on Multiple Hosts

{productName} software must be installed on all hosts where {productName} will run. How to install {productName} software on multiple
hosts depends on the degree of control that you require over the
installation on each host.

* If you require complete control over the installation on each host,
install the software from a {productName} distribution on each host
individually. For more information, see xref:installation-guide.adoc#GSING[{productName} Installation Guide].
* If the same set up on each host is acceptable, copy an existing
{productName} installation to the hosts. For more information, see
xref:#to-copy-a-glassfish-server-installation-to-multiple-hosts[To Copy a {productName} Installation to Multiple Hosts].

{productName} also enables you to remove {productName} software
from multiple hosts in a single operation. For more information, see
xref:#to-remove-glassfish-server-software-from-multiple-hosts[To Remove {productName} Software From Multiple Hosts].

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#to-copy-a-glassfish-server-installation-to-multiple-hosts[To Copy a {productName} Installation to Multiple Hosts]

==== To Copy a {productName} Installation to Multiple Hosts

Use the `install-node-dcom` subcommand or the `install-node-ssh`
subcommand in local mode to copy an installation of {productName}
software to multiple hosts.

Before You Begin

Ensure that DCOM or SSH is set up on the host where you are running the
subcommand and on each host where you are copying the {productName}
software.

Run the appropriate subcommand for the protocol that is set up for
communication between the hosts.

* If DCOM is set up for communication between the hosts, run the
`install-node-dcom` subcommand.

==== To Remove {productName} Software From Multiple Hosts

Use the `uninstall-node-dcom` subcommand or the `uninstall-node-ssh`
subcommand in local mode to remove {productName} software from
multiple hosts.

Before You Begin

Ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

* DCOM or SSH is set up on the host where you are running the subcommand
and on each host from which you are removing the {productName} software.

* No process is accessing the parent of the base installation directory
for the {productName} software or any subdirectory of this directory.

* The parent of the base installation directory for the {productName}
software is the same on each host from which you are removing the
{productName} software.

* For hosts that use DCOM for remote communication, the configuration of
the following items is the same on each host:

** Windows Domain
** Windows User

* For hosts that use SSH for remote communication, the configuration of
the following items is the same on each host:

** SSH port
** SSH user
** SSH key file

Run the appropriate subcommand for the protocol that is set up for
communication between the hosts.

* If DCOM is set up for communication between the hosts, run the
`uninstall-node-dcom` subcommand.
