instance
--------

an instance in \{product---name} has its own Java EE configuration, Java
EE resources, application deployment areas, and server configuration
settings

[[sthref2403]]

Description

\{product---name} creates one server instance, called `server` at the
time of installation. You can delete the server instance and create a
new instance with a different name.

For many users, one server instance meets their needs. However,
depending upon your environment, you might want to create additional
server instances. For example, in a development environment you can use
different server instances to test different \{product---name}
configurations, or to compare and test different application
deployments. Because you can easily add or delete a server instance, you
can use them to create temporary "sandbox" areas to experiment with
while developing.
