<h3 id="_establishing_performance_goals">Establishing Performance Goals</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At its simplest, high performance means maximizing throughput and
reducing response time. Beyond these basic goals, you can establish
specific goals by determining the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What types of applications and services are deployed, and how do
clients access them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which applications and services need to be highly available?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do the applications have session state or are they stateless?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What request capacity or throughput must the system support?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many concurrent users must the system support?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is an acceptable average response time for user requests?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the average think time between requests?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can calculate some of these metrics using a remote browser emulator
(RBE) tool, or web site performance and benchmarking software that
simulates expected application activity. Typically, RBE and benchmarking
products generate concurrent HTTP requests and then report the response
time for a given number of requests per minute. You can then use these
figures to calculate server activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The results of the calculations described in this chapter are not
absolute. Treat them as reference points to work against, as you
fine-tune the performance of GlassFish Server and your applications.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In broad terms, throughput measures the amount of work performed by
GlassFish Server. For GlassFish Server, throughput can be defined as the
number of requests processed per minute per server instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As described in the next section, GlassFish Server throughput is a
function of many factors, including the nature and size of user
requests, number of users, and performance of GlassFish Server instances
and back-end databases. You can estimate throughput on a single machine
by benchmarking with simulated workloads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>High availability applications incur additional overhead because they
periodically save session data. The amount of overhead depends on the
amount of data, how frequently it changes, and how often it is saved.
The first two factors depend on the application in question; the latter
is also affected by server settings.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_maximum_number_of_concurrent_users">Maximum Number of Concurrent Users</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users interact with an application through a client, such as a web
browser or Java program. Based on the user&#8217;s actions, the client
periodically sends requests to the GlassFish Server. A user is
considered active as long as the user&#8217;s session has neither expired nor
been terminated. When estimating the number of concurrent users, include
all active users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initially, as the number of users increases, throughput increases
correspondingly. However, as the number of concurrent requests
increases, server performance begins to saturate, and throughput begins
to decline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Identify the point at which adding concurrent users reduces the number
of requests that can be processed per minute. This point indicates when
optimal performance is reached and beyond which throughput start to
degrade. Generally, strive to operate the system at optimal throughput
as much as possible. You might need to add processing power to handle
additional load and increase throughput.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_think_time">Think Time</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A user does not submit requests continuously. A user submits a request,
the server receives and processes the request, and then returns a
result, at which point the user spends some time before submitting a new
request. The time between one request and the next is called think time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Think times are dependent on the type of users. For example,
machine-to-machine interaction such as for a web service typically has a
lower think time than that of a human user. You may have to consider a
mix of machine and human interactions to estimate think time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Determining the average think time is important. You can use this
duration to calculate the number of requests that need to be completed
per minute, as well as the number of concurrent users the system can
support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_average_response_time">Average Response Time</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Response time refers to the amount of time GlassFish Server takes to
return the results of a request to the user. The response time is
affected by factors such as network bandwidth, number of users, number
and type of requests submitted, and average think time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, response time refers to the mean, or average, response
time. Each type of request has its own minimal response time. However,
when evaluating system performance, base the analysis on the average
response time of all requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The faster the response time, the more requests per minute are being
processed. However, as the number of users on the system increases, the
response time starts to increase as well, even though the number of
requests per minute declines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A system performance graph indicates that after a certain point,
requests per minute are inversely proportional to response time. The
sharper the decline in requests per minute, the steeper the increase in
response time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The point of the peak load is the point at which requests per minute
start to decline. Prior to this point, response time calculations are
not necessarily accurate because they do not use peak numbers in the
formula. After this point, (because of the inversely proportional
relationship between requests per minute and response time), the
administrator can more accurately calculate response time using maximum
number of users and requests per minute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use the following formula to determine T<sub>response</sub>, the response time
(in seconds) at peak load:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>T<sub>response</sub> = n/r - T<sub>think</sub></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>n is the number of concurrent users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>r is the number requests per second the server receives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>T<sub>think</sub> is the average think time (in seconds)<br>
To obtain an accurate response time result, always include think time in
the equation.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example 2-1 Calculation of Response Time</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the following conditions exist:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maximum number of concurrent users, n, that the system can support at
peak load is 5,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximum number of requests, r, the system can process at peak load is
1,000 per second.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Average think time, T<sub>think</sub>, is three seconds per request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, the calculation of response time is:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>T<sub>response</sub> = n/r - T<sub>think</sub> = (5000/ 1000) - 3 sec. = 5 - 3 sec.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, the response time is two seconds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the system&#8217;s response time has been calculated, particularly at
peak load, compare it to the acceptable response time for the
application. Response time, along with throughput, is one of the main
factors critical to GlassFish Server performance.</p>

<div class="paragraph">

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_requests_per_minute">Requests Per Minute</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you know the number of concurrent users at any given time, the
response time of their requests, and the average user think time, then
you can calculate the number of requests per minute. Typically, start by
estimating the number of concurrent users that are on the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, after running web site performance software, the
administrator concludes that the average number of concurrent users
submitting requests on an online banking web site is 3,000. This number
depends on the number of users who have signed up to be members of the
online bank, their banking transaction behavior, the time of the day or
week they choose to submit requests, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, knowing this information enables you to use the requests per
minute formula described in this section to calculate how many requests
per minute your system can handle for this user base. Since requests per
minute and response time become inversely proportional at peak load,
decide if fewer requests per minute is acceptable as a trade-off for
better response time, or alternatively, if a slower response time is
acceptable as a trade-off for more requests per minute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Experiment with the requests per minute and response time thresholds
that are acceptable as a starting point for fine-tuning system
performance. Thereafter, decide which areas of the system require
adjustment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Solving for r in the equation in the previous section gives:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>r = n/(T<sub>response</sub> + T<sub>think</sub>)</p>

<p>You can separate external traffic, such as client requests, from the
internal traffic, such as session state failover, database transactions,
and messaging. Traffic separation enables you to plan a network better
and augment certain parts of the network, as required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To separate the traffic, run each server instance on a multi-homed
machine. A multi-homed machine has two IP addresses belonging to
different networks, an external IP and an internal IP. The objective is
to expose only the external IP to user requests. The internal IP is used
only by the cluster instances for internal communication. For details,
see "<a href="../ha-administration-guide/clusters.html#GSHAG00266">Using the Multi-Homing Feature With GMS</a>" in

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To plan for traffic on both networks, see <a href="#abfcq">Estimating

<p>To decide on the desired size and bandwidth of the network, first
determine the network traffic and identify its peak. Check if there is a
particular hour, day of the week, or day of the month when overall
volume peaks, and then determine the duration of that peak.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During peak load times, the number of packets in the network is at its
highest level. In general, if you design for peak load, scale your
system with the goal of handling 100 percent of peak volume. Bear in
mind, however, that any network behaves unpredictably and that despite
your scaling efforts, it might not always be able handle 100 percent of
peak volume.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, assume that at peak load, five percent of users
occasionally do not have immediate network access when accessing
applications deployed on GlassFish Server. Of that five percent,
estimate how many users retry access after the first attempt. Again, not
all of those users might get through, and of that unsuccessful portion,
another percentage will retry. As a result, the peak appears longer
because peak use is spread out over time as users continue to attempt
access.</p>

<p>A single T-1 line can handle 1.544 Mbps. Therefore, a network of four

average HTML page sent back to a client is 30 kilobytes (KB), this
network of four T-1 lines can handle the following traffic per second:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>6,176,000 bits/10 bits = 772,000 bytes per second</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>772,000 bytes per second/30 KB = approximately 25 concurrent response

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With traffic of 25 pages per second, this system can handle 90,000 pages
per hour (25 x 60 seconds x 60 minutes), and therefore 2,160,000 pages
per day maximum, assuming an even load throughout the day. If the
maximum peak load is greater than this, increase the bandwidth
accordingly.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the peak load lasts for two hours and takes up 30 percent of the
total load of 2,160,000 pages, this implies that 648,000 pages must be
carried over the T-1 lines during two hours of the day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, to accommodate peak load during those two hours, increase the
number of T-1 lines according to the following calculations:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>648,000 pages/120 minutes = 5,400 pages per minute</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>5,400 pages per minute/60 seconds = 90 pages per second</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If four lines can handle 25 pages per second, then approximately four
times that many pages requires four times that many lines, in this case
16 lines. The 16 lines are meant for handling the realistic maximum of a
30 percent peak load. Obviously, the other 70 percent of the load can be
handled throughout the rest of the day by these many lines.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To plan availability of systems and applications, assess the
availability needs of the user groups that access different
applications. For example, external fee-paying users and business
partners often have higher quality of service (QoS) expectations than
internal users. Thus, it may be more acceptable to internal users for an
application feature, application, or server to be unavailable than it
would be for paying external customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is an increasing cost and complexity to mitigating against
decreasingly probable events. At one end of the continuum, a simple
load-balanced cluster can tolerate localized application, middleware,
and hardware failures. At the other end of the scale, geographically
distinct clusters can mitigate against major catastrophes affecting the
entire data center.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To realize a good return on investment, it often makes sense to identify
availability requirements of features within an application. For
example, it may not be acceptable for an insurance quotation system to
be unavailable (potentially turning away new business), but brief
unavailability of the account management function (where existing
customers can view their current coverage) is unlikely to turn away
existing customers.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, a cluster is a group of GlassFish Server
instances—often hosted on multiple physical servers—that appear to
clients as a single instance. This provides horizontal scalability as
well as higher availability than a single instance on a single machine.
This basic level of clustering works in conjunction with the HTTP load
balancer plug-in, which accepts HTTP and HTTPS requests and forwards
them to one of the instances in the cluster. The ORB and integrated JMS
brokers also perform load balancing to GlassFish Server clusters. If an
instance fails, becomes unavailable (due to network faults), or becomes
unresponsive, requests are redirected only to existing, available
machines. The load balancer can also recognize when a failed instance
has recovered and redistribute load accordingly.</p>

<h4 id="_adding_redundancy_to_the_system">Adding Redundancy to the System</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way to achieve high availability is to add hardware and software
redundancy to the system. When one unit fails, the redundant unit takes
over. This is also referred to as fault tolerance. In general, to
maximize high availability, determine and remove every possible point of
failure in the system.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The level of redundancy is determined by the failure classes (types of
failure) that the system needs to tolerate. Some examples of failure
classes are:</p>

<p>Duplicated system processes tolerate single system process failures, as

tolerated.</p>

<p>Failover capacity planning implies deciding how many additional servers
and processes you need to add to the GlassFish Server deployment so that
in the event of a server or process failure, the system can seamlessly
recover data and continue processing. If your system gets overloaded, a
process or server failure might result, causing response time
degradation or even total loss of service. Preparing for such an
occurrence is critical to successful deployment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To maintain capacity, especially at peak loads, add spare machines
running GlassFish Server instances to the existing deployment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, consider a system with two machines running one GlassFish
Server instance each. Together, these machines handle a peak load of 300
requests per second. If one of these machines becomes unavailable, the
system will be able to handle only 150 requests, assuming an even load
distribution between the machines. Therefore, half the requests during
peak load will not be served.</p>

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>If the system is designed to handle peak load, it can sustain the
expected maximum load of users and requests without degrading response
time. This implies that the system can handle extreme cases of expected
system load. If the difference between peak load and steady state load
is substantial, designing for peak loads can mean spending money on
resources that are often idle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the system is designed to handle steady state load, it does not
have all the resources required to handle the expected peak load. Thus,
the system has a slower response time when peak load occurs.</p>

<p>How often the system is expected to handle peak load will determine
whether you want to design for peak load or for steady state.</p>

<p>If peak load occurs often—say, several times per day—it may be
worthwhile to expand capacity to handle it. If the system operates at
steady state 90 percent of the time, and at peak only 10 percent of the
time, then it may be preferable to deploy a system designed around
steady state load. This implies that the system&#8217;s response time will be
slower only 10 percent of the time. Decide if the frequency or duration
of time that the system operates at peak justifies the need to add
resources to the system.</p>

<p>The Java Message Service (JMS) API is a messaging standard that allows
Java EE applications and components to create, send, receive, and read
messages. It enables distributed communication that is loosely coupled,
reliable, and asynchronous. Message Queue, which implements JMS, is
integrated with GlassFish Server, enabling you to create components that
send and receive JMS messages, including message-driven beans (MDBs).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message Queue is integrated with GlassFish Server using a resource
adapter also known as a connector module. A resource adapter is a Java
EE component defined according to the Java EE Connector Architecture
(JCA) Specification. This specification defines a standardized way in
which application servers such as GlassFish Server can integrate with
enterprise information systems such as JMS providers. GlassFish Server
includes a resource adapter that integrates with its own JMS provider,
Message Queue. To use a different JMS provider, you must obtain and
deploy a suitable resource adapter that is designed to integrate with
it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating a JMS resource in GlassFish Server using the Administration
Console creates a preconfigured connector resource that uses the Message
Queue resource adapter. To create JMS Resources that use any other
resource adapter (including <code>GenericJMSRA</code>), you must create them under
the Connectors node in the Administration Console.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to using resource adapter APIs, GlassFish Server uses
additional Message Queue APIs to provide better integration with Message
Queue. This tight integration enables features such as connector
failover, load balancing of outbound connections, and load balancing of
inbound messages to MDBs. These features enable you to make messaging
traffic fault-tolerant and highly available.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message Queue supports using multiple interconnected broker instances
known as a broker cluster. With broker clusters, client connections are
distributed across all the brokers in the cluster. Clustering provides
horizontal scalability and improves availability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A single message broker scales to about eight CPUs and provides
sufficient throughput for typical applications. If a broker process
fails, it is automatically restarted. However, as the number of clients
connected to a broker increases, and as the number of messages being
delivered increases, a broker will eventually exceed limitations such as
number of file descriptors and memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having multiple brokers in a cluster rather than a single broker enables
you to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide messaging services despite hardware failures on a single
machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimize downtime while performing system maintenance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accommodate workgroups having different user repositories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deal with firewall restrictions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message Queue allows you to create conventional or enhanced broker
clusters. Conventional broker clusters offer service availability.
Enhanced broker clusters offer both service and data availability. For
more information, see "<a href="../../openmq/mq-admin-guide/broker-clusters.html#GMADG00041">Configuring and Managing Broker
Clusters</a>" in Open Message Queue Administration Guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a conventional cluster, having multiple brokers does not ensure that
transactions in progress at the time of a broker failure will continue
on the alternate broker. Although Message Queue reestablishes a failed
connection with a different broker in a cluster, transactions owned by
the failed broker are not available until it restarts. Except for failed
in-progress transactions, user applications can continue on the
failed-over connection. Service failover is thus ensured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an enhanced cluster, transactions and persistent messages owned by
the failed broker are taken over by another running broker in the
cluster and non-prepared transactions are rolled back. Data failover is
ensured for prepared transactions and persisted messages.</p>

<h5 id="_master_broker_and_client_synchronization_for_conventional_clusters">Master Broker and Client Synchronization for Conventional Clusters</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a configuration for a conventional broker cluster, each destination
is replicated on all of the brokers in a cluster. Each broker knows
about message consumers that are registered for destinations on all
other brokers. Each broker can therefore route messages from its own
directly-connected message producers to remote message consumers, and
deliver messages from remote producers to its own directly-connected
consumers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a cluster configuration, the broker to which each message producer is
directly connected performs the routing for messages sent to it by that
producer. Hence, a persistent message is both stored and routed by the
message&#8217;s home broker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever an administrator creates or destroys a destination on a broker,
this information is automatically propagated to all other brokers in a
cluster. Similarly, whenever a message consumer is registered with its
home broker, or whenever a consumer is disconnected from its home
broker—either explicitly or because of a client or network failure, or
because its home broker goes down—the relevant information about the
consumer is propagated throughout the cluster. In a similar fashion,
information about durable subscriptions is also propagated to all
brokers in a cluster.</p>

<p>A shared database of cluster change records can be configured as an
alternative to using a master broker. For more information, see

which leads to performance optimization. The EMBEDDED type is most
suitable for stand-alone GlassFish Server instances. EMBEDDED mode is
