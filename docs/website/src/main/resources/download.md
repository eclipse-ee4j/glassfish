## Eclipse GlassFish 7.x

Eclipse GlassFish is an application server, implementing Jakarta EE. This release is corresponding with the Jakarta EE 10 specification, which is a major new feature release. Jakarta EE 10 requires JDK 11 as a minimum, but also works on JDK 17 and JDK 21.

GlassFish 7.0.17 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs. It compiles and runs on JDK 11 to JDK 23. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.

In this summer 2024 release of GlassFish we did a lot of maintenance in which we will continue in future releases. We fixed several security issues and the build now passes also in Java 23. We welcome feedback - if you notice that something doesn't work as expected, feel free to create an issue or even better create your own pull request.
