Java DB server is available for use with {productName} and is based
upon Apache Derby. The database is typically started with the
xref:start-database.adoc#start-database[`start-database`(1)]

database server process for the specified port only.

This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

`--dbuser`::
  The user name of the Java DB user that is to stop the server process.
