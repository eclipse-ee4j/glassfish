 Bug Id: 4070025
 Product: cde
 Category: cde
 Subcategory: mail
 Release summary: cde1.2_37
 Bug/Rfe/EOU: rfe
 State: dispatched
 Development Status: 
 Synopsis: Allow separate, persistent message view window.
 Keywords: dtmail, separate, view, window
 Severity: 4
 Severity Impact: Limited
 Severity Functionality: Secondary
 Priority: 4
 Responsible Manager: vivianw
 Responsible Engineer: 
 Description:
Rather than have the message displayed in a pane below the headers,
customer would like the option to have a separate window where the
message contents could be viewed.  This window would be re-used for
the next message, so that only one view window would ever need to
be active.  Current functionality of double-clicking on a header
to bring up a separate window would not be affected.


 Justification:

 Work around:

 Suggested fix:
One way to implement this option would be to set the message pane height to
zero as a flag to maintain this separate view window.  This would allow users
to continue to use the current interface unchanged.
