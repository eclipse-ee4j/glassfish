12 Administering EIS Connectivity
---------------------------------

This chapter provides information and procedures for administering
connections to enterprise information system (EIS) data in the Oracle
GlassFish Server 5.0 environment by using the `asadmin` command-line
utility.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

If you installed the Web Profile, connector modules that use only
outbound communication features and work-management that does not
involve inbound communication features are supported. Other connector
features are supported only in the Full Platform Profile.

About EIS Connectivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enterprise information system (EIS) refers to any system that holds the
data of an organization. It can be a mainframe, a messaging system, a
database system, or an application. Connection resources are used by
applications and modules to access EIS software.)

The key elements of EIS connectivity are the following:

* Connector Module. A connector module, also called a resource adapter,
is a Java EE component that enables applications to interact with EIS
software. A connector module is used by GlassFish Server to implement
Java Message Service (JMS). Like other Java EE modules, a connector
module is installed when it is deployed. For instructions on creating a
connector module, see "link:../application-development-guide/connectors.html#GSDVG00013[Developing Connectors]" in
GlassFish Server Open Source Edition Application Development Guide.
* Connector Connection Pool. A connector connection pool is a group of
reusable connections for a particular EIS. A connector connection pool
is created when you specify the connector module that is associated with
the pool. For administration procedures, see link:#ablls[Administering
Connector Connection Pools].
* Connector Resource. A connector resource is a program object that
provides an application with a connection to an EIS. A connector
resource is created when you specify its JNDI name and its associated
connection pool. The JNDI name of a connector resource for an EIS is
usually in the `java:comp/env/`eis-specific subcontext. For
administration procedures, see link:#abllx[Administering Connector
Resources].
* Connector Module Configuration. A connector module configuration is
the information that resides in the domain configuration file
(`domain.xml`) for the particular connector module (resource adapter).
For administration procedures, see link:#giope[Administering the
Resource Adapter Configuration].
* Connector Security Map. A connector security map associates the caller
identity of the application (principal or user group) to a suitable EIS
principal or group. For administration procedures, see
link:#gitxy[Administering Connector Security Maps].
* Connector Work Security Map. A connector work security map associates
the caller identity of the work submitted by the connector module
(resource adapter) EIS principal or EIS user group to a suitable
principal or user group in the GlassFish Server security domain. For
administration procedures, see link:#giohl[Administering Connector Work
Security Maps].
* Administered Object. An administered object provides specialized
functionality for an application, such as providing access to a parser
that is specific to the connector module and its associated EIS. For
administration procedures, see link:#ablmc[Administering Administered
Objects].

At runtime, the following sequence occurs when an application connects
to an EIS:

1.  The application gets the connector resource (data source) associated
with the EIS by making a call through the JNDI API. +
Using the JNDI name of the connector resource, the naming and directory
service locates the resource. Each EIS resource specifies a connector
connection pool.
2.  Using the connector resource, the application gets an EIS
connection. +
GlassFish Server retrieves a physical connection from the connection
pool that corresponds to the EIS resource. The pool defines connection
attributes such as the EIS name, user name, and password.
3.  After the EIS connection is established, the application can read,
modify, and add data to the EIS. +
The application accesses the EIS information by making calls to the JMS
API.
4.  When the application is finished accessing the EIS, the application
closes the connection and returns the connection to the connection pool.

After a connector module has been deployed, you are ready to create a
connector connection pool for it.

[[gioce]][[GSADG00431]][[to-create-a-connector-connection-pool]]

To Create a Connector Connection Pool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the `create-connector-connection-pool` subcommand in remote mode to
create a connector connection pool for a deployed connector module. When
you are building the connector connection pool, certain data specific to
the EIS will be required. The value in the mandatory
`--connectiondefintion` option provides the EIS info.

Multiple connector resources can specify a single connection pool.

Creating a connector connection pool is a dynamic event and does not
require server restart. However, there are some parameters that do
require server restart. See link:overview.html#ghciy[Configuration
Changes That Require Restart].

[[GSADG968]]

Before You Begin

Before creating the connector connection pool, the connector must be
installed.

1.  Ensure that the server is running. +
Remote subcommands require a running server.
2.  Create the connector connection pool by using the
link:../reference-manual/create-connector-connection-pool.html#GSRFM00018[`create-connector-connection-pool`] subcommand. +
Information about properties for the subcommand is included in this help
page.
3.  If needed, restart the server. +
Some properties require server restart. See
link:overview.html#ghciy[Configuration Changes That Require Restart]. If
your server needs to be restarted, see link:domains.html#ginqj[To Restart
a Domain].
4.  You can verify that a connection pool is usable by using the
`ping-connection-pool` subcommand. +
For instructions, see link:jdbc.html#ggnwn[To Contact (Ping) a Connection
Pool].

Administering Connector Work Security Maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EIS is any system that holds the data of an organization. It can be
a mainframe, a messaging system, a database system, or an application.
The connector work security map is used to is used to map the EIS
credentials to the credentials of GlassFish Server security domain.

A security map applies to a particular connector connection pool. One or
more named security maps can be associated with a connector connection
pool.

* link:#gioir[To List Connector Work Security Maps]

To Create a Connector Work Security Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the `create-connector-work-security-map` subcommand in remote mode
to map the caller identity of the work submitted by the connector module
(resource adapter) EIS principal or EIS user group to a suitable
principal or user group in the GlassFish Server security domain. One or
more work security maps can be associated with a connector module.

The connector security map configuration supports the use of the wild
card asterisk (*) to indicate all users or all user groups.

Before You Begin

Before creating a connector work security map, you must first create a
connector connection pool. For instructions, see link:#gioce[To Create a
Connector Connection Pool].

1.  Ensure that the server is running. +
Remote subcommands require a running server.
2.  Create the connector work security map by using the
link:../reference-manual/create-connector-work-security-m.html#GSRFM00021[`create-connector-work-security-map`] subcommand. +
Information about properties for the subcommand is included in this help
page.
3.  If needed, restart the server. +
Some properties require server restart. See
link:overview.html#ghciy[Configuration Changes That Require Restart]. If
your server needs to be restarted, see link:domains.html#ginqj[To Restart
a Domain].

Administering Administered Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Packaged within a connector module, an administered object provides
specialized functionality for an application. For example, an
administered object might provide access to a parser that is specific to
the connector module and its associated EIS.

The following topics are addressed here:

* link:#giolr[To Create an Administered Object]
* link:#giokm[To List Administered Objects]
* link:#giots[To Update an Administered Object]

To Create an Administered Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the `create-admin-object` subcommand to create an administered
object resource. When creating an administered object resource,
name-value pairs are created, and the object is associated to a JNDI
name.

[[GSADG986]]

Before You Begin

The resource adapter must be deployed before running this subcommand
(`jmsrar.rar`).
