A more sophisticated idea might be: write a GUI that
presents a property sheet editor for your bean. You write
this only once, such that it would work for all the beans
you develop. Have the GUI serialize your bean's state,
as modified by the user. Use java.util.zip classes to
write the serialized state back into your original JAR
file. Voila. No config file, no messy parsing, no comp-
licated instructions for your users to get wrong.
