[[sthref407]]

Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these
  options, see the link:asadmin.html#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--enabled`::
  Determines whether the resource is enabled at runtime. The default
  value is `true`.
`--contextinfoenabled`::
  Determines whether container contexts are propagated to threads. If
  set to `true`, the contexts specified in the `--contextinfo` option
  are propagated. If set to `false`, no contexts are propagated and the
  `--contextinfo` option is ignored. The default value is `true`.
`--contextinfo`::
  Specifies individual container contexts to propagate to threads. Valid
  values are Classloader, JNDI, Security, and WorkArea. Values are
  specified in a comma-separated list and are case-insensitive. All
  contexts are propagated by default.
`--threadpriority`::
  Specifies the priority to assign to created threads. The default value
  is 5.
`--longrunningtasks`::
  Specifies whether the resource should be used for long-running tasks.
  The default value is `false`. If set to `true`, long-running tasks are
  not reported as stuck.
`--hungafterseconds`::
  Specifies the number of seconds that a task can execute before it is
  considered unresponsive. The default value is 0, which means that
  tasks are never considered unresponsive.
`--hungloggerinitialdelayseconds`::
  Specifies the number of seconds to delay logging the detection of hung
  tasks. The default value is 60.
`--hungloggerintervalseconds`::
  Specifies the number of seconds between logging the detection of hung
  tasks. The default value is 60.
`--corepoolsize`::
  Specifies the number of threads to keep in a thread pool, even if they
  are idle. The default value is 0, which means that a thread is created
  when the first task is scheduled.
`--keepaliveseconds`::
  Specifies the number of seconds that threads can remain idle when the
  number of threads is greater than `corepoolsize`. The default value is
  60.
`--threadlifetimeseconds`::
  Specifies the number of seconds that threads can remain in a thread
  pool before being purged, regardless of whether the number of threads
  is greater than `corepoolsize` or whether the threads are idle. The
  default value is 0, which means that threads are never purged.
`--description`::
  Descriptive details about the resource.
`--property`::
  Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the resource. +
  \{product---name} does not define any additional properties for this
  resource. Moreover, this resource does not currently use any
  additional properties.
`--target`::
  Specifies the target for which you are creating the resource. Valid
  targets are: +
  `server`;;
    Creates the resource for the default server instance. This is the
    default value.
  `domain`;;
    Creates the resource for the domain.
  cluster_name;;
    Creates the resource for every server instance in the specified
    cluster.
  instance_name;;
    Creates the resource for the specified server instance.
