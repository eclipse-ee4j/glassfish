  JavaBeans components.  We've extended the registration deadline, so there's

  information, or to register, see:

JavaBeans Migration Assistant for ActiveX Available for Download

  The JavaBeans Migration Assistant for ActiveX is a tool that
  generates JavaBeans code from an ActiveX control.  This tool
  analyzes an ActiveX control's properties and creates a 100% Pure
  Java container that takes on the features of the ActiveX control and
  then implements the component functions.  If you are an ActiveX
  developer, and you want to participate in the growing JavaBeans
  market, this is the fastest way to leverage your existing investment
  to gain an early foothold in this new market.

  The free JavaBeans Migration Assistant for ActiveX is available for
  download at:

	http://java.sun.com/beans/assistant/


InfoBus Specification Available for Download and Public Comment 

  At JavaOne, Sun and Lotus Development announced that they were
  working together to develop Lotus's InfoBus dynamic data interchange
  architecture into a Java standard for use by JavaBeans developers.
  The first draft technical specifications for InfoBus are now
  available for download at:

	http://java.sun.com/beans/infobus/


JFC Developer Release Public Download Now Available 

  Sun and Netscape have announced the availability of the first
  developer release of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) for public
  download through the Java Developer Connection.  All of the JFC
  components are JavaBeans components, so developers can easily bring
  in other JavaBeans GUI components to enhance their applications.
  For more information, see the JFC web site at:

	http://java.sun.com/products/jfc


JavaBeans Bridge for ActiveX Beta 5 Available Wednesday, August 6

  The Beta 5 release of the JavaBeans Bridge for ActiveX will be 
  available for download at:

	http://java.sun.com/beans/bridge/
  This release includes administrative enhancements, better 
  Internet Explorer support, bug fixes, and an improved runtime version.
  See the Readme file that comes with the JavaBeans Bridge for ActiveX 
  for more details. 

  The JavaBeans Bridge for ActiveX allows any JavaBeans component to
  be hosted by any legacy COM/OLE/ActiveX container.  With the
  JavaBeans Bridge for ActiveX, developers can migrate their
  development efforts easily to JavaBeans today, while preserving
  their investment in - and adding value to - any previous work based
  on ActiveX.

Correction to Last Month's Note

  There was an error in last month's "New Beans from Old Beans" note.
  In the section "Use BeanInfo to modify the features", it should have
  read...

    Now, though we can modified the features through a BeanInfo class,
    which in this case is using the support class
    java.beans.SimpleBeanInfo.  For example, in the code fragment
    shown below we define an icon for the Bean, and we give it a
    customizer class.

     package sunw.demo.buttons;
     public class ExplicitButtonBeanInfo extends java.beans.SimpleBeanInfo {
       ...
       public java.awt.Image getIcon(int iconKind) {
       ...
       }
       private final static Class customizerClass = OurButtonCustomizer.class;
     }

    BeanInfo is a powerful mechanism that will help you in creating
    new Beans from old Beans.

  We apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused.
