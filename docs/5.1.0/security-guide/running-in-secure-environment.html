<p>Before you deploy GlassFish Server and your Java EE applications into a
production environment, determine your security needs and make sure that
you take the appropriate security measures, as described in the
following sections:</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_understand_your_environment">Understand Your Environment</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To better understand your security needs, ask yourself the following
questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Which resources am I protecting?<br>
Many resources in the production environment can be protected, including
information in databases accessed by GlassFish Server and the
availability, performance, applications, and the integrity of the Web
site. Consider the resources you want to protect when deciding the level
of security you must provide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From whom am I protecting the resources?<br>
For most Web sites, resources must be protected from everyone on the
Internet. But should the Web site be protected from the employees on the
intranet in your enterprise? Should your employees have access to all
resources within the GlassFish Server environment? Should the system
administrators have access to all GlassFish Server resources? Should the
system administrators be able to access all data? You might consider
giving access to highly confidential data or strategic resources to only
a few well trusted system administrators. Perhaps it would be best to
allow no system administrators access to the data or resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What will happen if the protections on strategic resources fail?<br>
In some cases, a fault in your security scheme is easily detected and
considered nothing more than an inconvenience. In other cases, a fault
might cause great damage to companies or individual clients that use the
Web site. Understanding the security ramifications of each resource will
help you protect it properly.</p>

in a secure environment. The <a href="#gkscn">Enable the Secure
Administration Feature</a> topic is described.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_enable_the_secure_administration_feature">Enable the Secure Administration Feature</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The secure administration feature allows an administrator to secure all
administrative communication between the domain administration server
(DAS), any remote instances, and administration clients such as the
asadmin utility, the administration console, and REST clients. In
addition, secure administration helps to prevent DAS-to-DAS and
instance-to-instance traffic, and carefully restricts
administration-client-to-instance traffic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you install GlassFish Server or create a new domain, secure admin
is disabled by default. GlassFish Server does not encrypt administrative
communication among the system components and does not accept
administrative connections from remote hosts. Imposing a heightened
level of security is optional.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your applications can run on the Web Profile, use that instead of the
Full Platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Starting in Java EE 6, Java EE introduced the concept of profiles. A
profile is a collection of Java EE technologies and APIs that address
specific developer communities and application types.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following profiles are implemented through the distributions of
GlassFish Server:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Full Platform -The full Java EE platform is designed for developers
who require the full set of Java EE APIs for enterprise application
development, and is installed when you install GlassFish Server. This
profile is also installed as part of the Java EE 8 SDK installation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web Profile -This profile contains Web technologies that are a subset
of the full Java platform, and is designed for developers who do not
require the full set of Java EE APIs. This profile is also installed
with Java EE 8 Web Profile SDK.</p>

<p>Auditing is the process of recording key security events in your
GlassFish Server environment. You use audit modules to develop an audit
trail of all authentication and authorization decisions. To enable audit
logging, two steps are required:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>On the Security page, select the Audit Logging Enabled checkbox to
enable audit logging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the <code>auditOn</code> property for the active audit module to true.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Review the auditing records periodically to detect security breaches and
attempted breaches. Noting repeated failed logon attempts or a
surprising pattern of security events can prevent serious problems.</p>
</div></div></td>

<p>Consider setting module log levels for
table.javax.enterprise.system.ssl.security and

levels may produce a large log file.</p>

<p>Although much of the responsibility for securing the GlassFish Server
resources in a domain fall within the scope of the server, some security
responsibilities lie within the scope of individual applications. For
some security options, GlassFish Server enables you to determine whether
the server or individual applications are responsible. For each
application that you deploy in a production environment, review the
items in the following table to verify that you have secured its
resources.</p>

<p>Of particular concern is code that uses Java native interface (JNI)
because Java positions native code outside of the scope of Java
security. If Java native code behaves errantly, it is only constrained
by the operating system. That is, the Java native code can do anything
GlassFish Server itself can do. This potential vulnerability is further
complicated by the fact that buffer overflow errors are common in native
code and can be used to run arbitrary code.</p>

useful. See "<a href="../application-development-guide/securing-apps.html#GSDVG00373">Enabling and Disabling the Security

<p>The ability to return user-supplied data can present a security
vulnerability called cross-site scripting, which can be exploited to
steal a user&#8217;s security authorization. For a detailed description of
cross-site scripting, refer to "Understanding Malicious Content
Mitigation for Web Developers" (a CERT security advisory) at
<code><a href="http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_mitigation.html" class="bare">http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_mitigation.html</a></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To remove the security vulnerability, before you return data that a user
has supplied, scan the data for HTML special characters. If you find any
such characters, replace them with their HTML entity or character
reference. Replacing the characters prevents the browser from executing
the user-supplied data as HTML.</p>
