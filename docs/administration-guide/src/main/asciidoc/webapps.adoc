== 6 Administering Web Applications

This chapter explains how to administer web applications in the
{productName} 7 environment.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<Invoking a Servlet by Alternate Means>>
* <<Changing Log Output for a Servlet>>
* <<Defining Global Features for Web Applications>>
* <<Redirecting a URL>>
* <<Administering `mod_jk`>>
* <<Administering `mod_proxy_ajp`>>

Instructions for accomplishing some of these tasks by using the
Administration Console are contained in the Administration Console
online help.

[[invoking-a-servlet-by-alternate-means]]

=== Invoking a Servlet by Alternate Means

You can call a servlet deployed to {productName} by using a URL in a
browser or embedded as a link in an HTML or JSP file. The format of a
servlet invocation URL is as follows:

[source]
----
http://server:port/context-root/servlet-mapping?name=value
----

The following table describes each URL section.

[[fvyhk]]

Table 6-1 URL Fields for Servlets Within an Application

[width="100%",cols="21%,79%",options="header",]
|===
|URL element |Description
|server`:`port a|
The IP address (or host name) and optional port number.

To access the default web module for a virtual server, specify only this
URL section. You do not need to specify the context-root or servlet-name
unless you also wish to specify name-value parameters.

|context-root a|
For an application, the context root is defined in the `context-root`
element of the `application.xml`, `sun-application.xml`, or
`sun-web.xml` file. For an individually deployed web module, the context
root is specified during deployment.

For both applications and individually deployed web modules, the default
context root is the name of the WAR file minus the `.war` suffix.

|servlet-mapping |The `servlet-mapping` as configured in the `web.xml`
file.

|`?`name`=`value`...` |Optional request parameters.
|===


[[giyhf]]
Example 6-1 Invoking a Servlet With a URL

In this example, `localhost` is the host name, `MortPages` is the
context root, and `calcMortgage` is the servlet mapping.

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/MortPages/calcMortgage?rate=8.0&per=360&bal=180000
----

[[giyib]]
Example 6-2 Invoking a Servlet From Within a JSP File

To invoke a servlet from within a JSP file, you can use a relative path.
For example:

[source,xml]
----
<jsp:forward page="TestServlet"/><jsp:include page="TestServlet"/>
----

[[changing-log-output-for-a-servlet]]

=== Changing Log Output for a Servlet

`ServletContext.log` messages are sent to the server log. By default,
the `System.out` and `System.err` output of servlets are sent to the
server log. During startup, server log messages are echoed to the
`System.err` output. Also by default, there is no Windows-only console
for the `System.err` output.

You can change these defaults using the Administration Console Write to
System Log box. If this box is checked, `System.out` output is sent to
the server log. If it is unchecked, `System.out` output is sent to the
system default location only.

[[defining-global-features-for-web-applications]]

=== Defining Global Features for Web Applications

You can use the `default-web.xml` file to define features such as
filters and security constraints that apply to all web applications.

For example, directory listings are disabled by default for added
security. To enable directory listings in your domain's
`default-web.xml` file, search for the definition of the servlet whose
`servlet-name` is equal to `default`, and set the value of the
`init-param` named `listings` to `true`. Then restart the server.

[source,xml]
----
<init-param>
   <param-name>listings</param-name>
   <param-value>true</param-value>
</init-param>
----

If `listings` is set to `true`, you can also determine how directory
listings are sorted. Set the value of the `init-param` named `sortedBy`
to `NAME`, `SIZE`, or `LAST_MODIFIED`. Then restart the server.

[source,xml]
----
<init-param>
   <param-name>sortedBy</param-name>
   <param-value>LAST_MODIFIED</param-value>
</init-param>
----

The `mime-mapping` elements in `default-web.xml` are global and
inherited by all web applications. You can override these mappings or
define your own using `mime-mapping` elements in your web application's
`web.xml` file. For more information about `mime-mapping` elements, see
the Servlet specification.

You can use the Administration Console to edit the `default-web.xml`
file, or edit the file directly using the following steps.

[[to-use-the-default-web.xml-file]]

==== To Use the `default-web.xml` File

1. Place the JAR file for the filter, security constraint, or other
feature in the domain-dir``/lib`` directory.
2. Edit the domain-dir``/config/default-web.xml`` file to refer to the JAR file.
3. To apply your changes, restart {productName}.
+
See xref:domains.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart a Domain].

[[redirecting-a-url]]

=== Redirecting a URL

You can specify that a request for an old URL be treated as a request
for a new URL. This is called redirecting a URL.

To specify a redirected URL for a virtual server, use the `redirect_n`
property, where n is a positive integer that allows specification of
more than one. Each of these `redirect_n` properties is inherited by all
web applications deployed on the virtual server.

The value of each `redirect_n` property has two components which can be
specified in any order:

* The first component, `from`, specifies the prefix of the requested URI
to match.
* The second component, `url-prefix`, specifies the new URL prefix to
return to the client. The from prefix is replaced by this URL prefix.

[[giyis]]
Example 6-3 Redirecting a URL

This example redirects `from` `dummy` to `etude`:

[source,xml]
----
<property name="redirect_1" value="from=/dummy url-prefix=http://etude"/>
----

[[administering-mod_jk]]

=== Administering `mod_jk`

The Apache Tomcat Connector `mod_jk` can be used to connect the web
container with web servers such as Apache HTTP Server. By using
`mod_jk`, which comes with {productName}, you can front {productName} with Apache HTTP Server.

You can also use `mod_jk` directly at the JSP/servlet engine for load
balancing. For more information about configuring `mod_jk` and Apache
HTTP Server for load balancing with {productName} 7 refer to
"xref:ha-administration-guide.adoc#configuring-http-load-balancing[Configuring HTTP Load Balancing]" in {productName} High Availability Administration Guide.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<To Enable `mod_jk`>>
* <<To Load Balance Using `mod_jk` and {productName}>>
* xref:#to-enable-ssl-between-the-mod_jk-load-balancer-and-the-browser[To Enable SSL Between the `mod_jk` Load Balancer and the
Browser]
* xref:#to-enable-ssl-between-the-mod_jk-load-balancer-and-glassfish-server[To Enable SSL Between the `mod_jk` Load Balancer and
{productName}]

[[to-enable-mod_jk]]

==== To Enable `mod_jk`

You can front {productName} with Apache HTTP Server by enabling the
`mod_jk` protocol for one of {productName}'s network listeners, as
described in this procedure. A typical use for `mod_jk` would be to have
Apache HTTP Server handle requests for static resources, while having
requests for dynamic resources, such as servlets and JavaServer Pages
(JSPs), forwarded to, and handled by the {productName} back-end
instance.

When you use the `jk-enabled` attribute of the network listener, you do
not need to copy any additional JAR files into the ``/lib`` directory. You
can also create JK connectors under different virtual servers by using
the network listener attribute `jk-enabled`.

1. Install Apache HTTP Server and `mod_jk`.
* For information on installing Apache HTTP Server, see
`http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/install.html`.
* For information on installing `mod_jk`, see
`http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/webserver_howto/apache.html`.
2. Configure the following files:
* `apache2/conf/httpd.conf`, the main Apache configuration file
* `apache2/conf/workers.properties`
+
xref:gixrq[Example 6-4] and xref:gixqt[Example 6-5] provide examples
of configuring these two files.
3. Start Apache HTTP Server (`httpd`).
4. Start {productName} with at least one web application deployed.
+
In order for the `mod_jk`-enabled network listener to start listening
for requests, the web container must be started. Normally, this is
achieved by deploying a web application.
5. Create a jk-enabled network listener by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-network-listener[`create-network-listener`] subcommand.
+
[source]
----
asadmin> create-network-listener --protocol http-listener-1 \
--listenerport 8009 --jkenabled true jk-connector
----
6. If you are using the `glassfish-jk.properties` file to use
non-default values of attributes described at
`http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/ajp.html`), set the
`jk-configuration-file` property of the network listener to the
fully-qualified file name of the `glassfish-jk.properties` file.
+
[source]
----
asadmin> set server-config.network-config.network-listeners.network-listener.\
jk-connector.jk-configuration-file=domain-dir/config/glassfish-jk.properties
----
7. If you expect to need more than five threads for the listener,
increase the maximum threads in the `http-thread-pool` pool:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> set configs.config.server-config.thread-pools.thread-pool.\
http-thread-pool.max-thread-pool-size=value
----
8. To apply your changes, restart {productName}.
+
See xref:domains.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart a Domain].

[[to-load-balance-using-mod_jk-and-glassfish-server]]

==== To Load Balance Using `mod_jk` and {productName}

Load balancing is the process of dividing the amount of work that a
computer has to do between two or more computers so that more work gets
done in the same amount of time. Load balancing can be configured with
or without security.

In order to support stickiness, the Apache `mod_jk` load balancer relies
on a `jvmRoute` system property that is included in any `JSESSIONID`
received by the load balancer. This means that every {productName}
instance that is front-ended by the Apache load balancer must be
configured with a unique `jvmRoute` system property.

1. On each of the instances, perform the steps in xref:#to-enable-mod_jk[To Enable
`mod_jk`].
+
If your instances run on the same machine, you must choose different JK
ports. The ports must match `worker.worker*.port` in your
`workers.properties` file. See the properties file in
xref:gixqt[Example 6-5].
2. On each of the instances, create the `jvmRoute` system property of
{productName} by using the xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-jvm-options[`create-jvm-options`]
subcommand.
+
Use the following format:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> create-jvm-options "-DjvmRoute=/instance-worker-name"/
----
where instance-worker-name is the name of the worker that you defined to
represent the instance in the `workers.properties` file.
3. To apply your changes, restart Apache HTTP Server and {productName}.

[[to-enable-ssl-between-the-mod_jk-load-balancer-and-the-browser]]

==== To Enable SSL Between the `mod_jk` Load Balancer and the Browser

To activate security for `mod_jk` on {productName}, you must first
generate a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) self-signed certificate on the
Apache HTTP Server with the `mod_ssl` module. The tasks include
generating a private key, a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), a
self-signed certificate, and configuring SSL-enabled virtual hosts.

Before You Begin

The `mod_jk` connector must be enabled.

1. Generate the private key as follows:
+
[source]
----
openssl genrsa -des3 -rand file1:file2:file3:file4:file5 -out server.key 1024
----
where `file1:file2:` and so on represents the random compressed files.
2. Remove the pass-phrase from the key as follows:
+
[source]
----
openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.pem
----
3. Generate the CSR is as follows:
+
[source]
----
openssl req -new -key server.pem -out server.csr
----
Enter the information you are prompted for.
4. Generate a temporary certificate as follows:
+
[source]
----
openssl x509 -req -days 60 -in server.csr -signkey server.pem -out server.crt
----
This temporary certificate is good for 60 days.
5. Create the `http-ssl.conf` file under the `/etc/apache2/conf.d`
directory.
6. In the `http-ssl.conf` file, add one of the following redirects:
* Redirect a web application, for example, `JkMount /hello/* worker1`.
* Redirect all requests, for example, `JkMount /* worker1`.
+
[source]
----
# Send all jsp requests to GlassFish
JkMount /*.jsp worker1
# Send all glassfish-test requests to GlassFish
JkMount /glassfish-test/* loadbalancer
----

[[gjpnc]]

[[to-enable-ssl-between-the-mod_jk-load-balancer-and-glassfish-server]]

==== To Enable SSL Between the `mod_jk` Load Balancer and {productName}

This procedure does not enable SSL transfer between `mod_jk` and
{productName}. It enables `mod_jk` to forward SSL-encrypted
information from the browser to {productName}.

Before You Begin

The self-signed certificate must be configured.

1. Perform the steps in <<To Enable `mod_jk`>>.
2. Start another {productName} with at least one web application
deployed.
+
In order for the `mod_jk`-enabled network listener to start listening
for requests, the web container must be started. Normally, this is
achieved by deploying a web application.
3. Follow instructions from xref:http_https.adoc#to-configure-an-http-listener-for-ssl[To Configure an
HTTP Listener for SSL] on the `mod_jk` connector.
+
Use the following format:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> create-ssl --type http-listener --certname sampleCert new-listener
----
4. Add the following directives in the `httpd.conf` file under the
`/etc/apache2/conf.d` directory:
+
[source]
----
# Should mod_jk send SSL information (default is On)
JkExtractSSL On
# What is the indicator for SSL (default is HTTPS)
JkHTTPSIndicator HTTPS
# What is the indicator for SSL session (default is SSL_SESSION_ID)
JkSESSIONIndicator SSL_SESSION_ID

[[to-load-balance-using-mod_proxy_ajp-and-glassfish-server]]
==== To Load Balance Using `mod_proxy_ajp` and {productName}

Load balancing is the process of dividing the amount of work that a
computer has to do between two or more computers so that more work gets
