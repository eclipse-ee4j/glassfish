=== Update Tool FAQs

[[how-do-i-use-update-tool-to-extend-my-glassfish-server-installation]]

==== How Do I Use Update Tool to Extend My {productName} Installation?

Enterprise Server provides an administrative tool called Update Tool
that enables you to install updates and add-on components to your
existing Enterprise Server installation.

Update Tool can be accessed as a standalone graphical tool from the
command line (using the `updatetool` command from
as-install-parent``/bin``), or as a browser-based graphical tool from the
Administration Console (using the Update Tool node). For more
information about Update Tool, see "xref:administration-guide.adoc#GSADG00701[Update Tool]" in
{productName} Administration Guide.

[NOTE]
====
To update or remove installed components, you must use the standalone
graphical Update Tool, not the Administration Console Update Tool.
====

A command-line interface is also available for Update Tool. This
interface uses the `pkg` command and enables you to perform most of the
tasks provided by the standalone graphical version. For more information
about the `pkg` command, see "xref:administration-guide.adoc#GSADG00014[Extending and Updating
{productName}]" in {productName}
Administration Guide.

[NOTE]
====
Update Tool differs from Upgrade Tool, which is used to migrate the
configuration and deployed applications from an earlier version of
{productName} to the current version. For more information about
Upgrade Tool and upgrading, see the xref:upgrade-guide.adoc#GSUPG[{productName} Upgrade Guide].
