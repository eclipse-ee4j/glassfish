Thanks Jacob -- My concern is that we shoudl not summarily, without
proper cause, discourage or disable future abilities of developers to
deal with MHTML hyperlinks across separate messages.

If we suggest, or alowe interpretation to conclude that it is not the
right thing to enable, surely many developers will seriously disable
any possible potential.

So, if we see how to do it, then we need to identify the possibilities
and state clearly that it is possible, is OK to do, and is in fact
encouraged where ever possible.

I think it might only be a matter of emphasis.
Lets discuss this in Munich.

Cheers...\Stef

}RFC 2110 probably allows this, since it says that Content-ID can
}be used to identify a body part, and MIME Content-ID-s are globally
}unique according to RFC 2110.
}
}However, RFC 2110 says:
}
}   A body part, such as a text/HTML body part, may contain hyperlinks to
}   objects which are included as other body parts in the same message
}   and within the same multipart/related content.
}
}And this might of course be interpreted to mean that hyperlinks to
}body parts in other messages are not allowed, but I do not think
}that was the intention.
}
}RFC 2110 also says:
}
}   If a message contains one or more MIME body parts containing links
}   and also contains as separate body parts, data, to which these links
}   (as defined, for example, in RFC 1866 [HTML2]) refers, then this
}   whole set of body parts (referring body parts and referred-to body
}   parts) SHOULD be sent within a multipart/related body part as defined
}   in [REL].
}
}This however only applies to body parts within the same message,
}so this probably will not forbid references to body parts in other
}messages.
}
}Anothing thing is that many implementations may have problems with
}links between messages!
