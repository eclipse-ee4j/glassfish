[[remove-library]]

== remove-library

Removes one or more library JAR files from {productName}

=== Synopsis

[source]
----
asadmin [asadmin-options] remove-library [--help]
[--type={common|ext|app}]
library-name [library-name ... ]
----

=== Description

The `remove-library` subcommand removes one or more library JAR files
from {productName}.

The `--type` option specifies the library type and the {productName}
directory from which the library is removed.

The library-name operand is the name of the JAR file that contains the
library to be removed. To specify multiple libraries, specify multiple
names separated by spaces.

[NOTE]
====
The library archive file is removed from the DAS. For common and
extension libraries, you must restart the DAS so the library removals
are picked up by the server runtime. To remove the libraries from other
server instances, synchronize the instances with the DAS by restarting
them.

This command is not supported on the Windows operating system.
====

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

`--help`::

  `ext`;;
    Removes the library files from the Java optional package directory,
    domain-dir`/lib/ext`.
  `app`;;
    Removes the library files from the application-specific class loader

For more information about these directories, see
