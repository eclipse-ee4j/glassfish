Using the `asadmin` Utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the `asadmin` utility to perform administrative tasks for GlassFish
Server from the command line or from a script. You can use this utility
instead of the Administration Console interface.

The following topics are addressed here:

* link:#giwdb[Path to the `asadmin` Utility]
* link:#givvn[`asadmin` Utility Syntax]
* link:#ghvzx[To Run an `asadmin` Utility Subcommand in Single Mode]
* link:#givlw[To Display Help Information for the `asadmin` Utility or a
Subcommand]
* link:#giodz[To Start a Multimode Session]
* link:#givjn[To End a Multimode Session]
* link:#givjd[To Run a Set of `asadmin` Subcommands From a File]
* link:#CACDDHBA[To Run `asadmin` Subcommands in `--detach` Mode]

[[giwdb]][[GSADG00705]][[path-to-the-asadmin-utility]]

Path to the `asadmin` Utility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `asadmin` utility is located in the as-install`/bin` directory. To
run the `asadmin` utility without specifying the path, ensure that this
directory is in your path.

[[givvn]][[GSADG00706]][[asadmin-utility-syntax]]

`asadmin` Utility Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The syntax for running the `asadmin` utility is as follows:

[source]
----
asadmin [asadmin-util-options] [subcommand [subcommand-options] [operands]]
----

The replaceable items in this syntax are described in the subsections
that follow. For full details of this syntax, see the
https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/doc/5.0/reference-manual.pdf[`asadmin`(1M)]
help page.

[[ghvzn]][[GSADG00631]][[subcommands-of-the-asadmin-utility]]

Subcommands of the `asadmin` Utility
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The subcommand identifies the operation or task that you are performing.
Subcommands are case-sensitive. Each subcommand is either a local
subcommand or a remote subcommand.

* A local subcommand can be run without a running domain administration
server (DAS). However, to run the subcommand and have access to the
installation directory and the domain directory, the user must be logged
in to the machine that hosts the domain.
* A remote subcommand is always run by connecting to a DAS and running
the subcommand there. A running DAS is required.

For a list of the subcommands for this release of GlassFish Server, see
Section 1 of the
https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/doc/5.0/reference-manual.pdf[GlassFish
Server Open Source Edition Reference Manual].

[[ghvyd]][[GSADG00632]][[asadmin-utility-options-and-subcommand-options]]

`asadmin` Utility Options and Subcommand Options
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Options control the behavior of the `asadmin` utility and its
subcommands. Options are case-sensitive.

The `asadmin` utility has the following types of options:

* `asadmin` utility options. These options control the behavior of the
`asadmin` utility, not the subcommand. The `asadmin` utility options may
precede or follow the subcommand, but `asadmin` utility options after
the subcommand are deprecated. All `asadmin` utility options must either
precede or follow the subcommand. If `asadmin` utility options are
specified both before and after the subcommand, an error occurs. For a
description of the `asadmin` utility options, see the
link:../reference-manual/asadmin.html#GSRFM00263[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.
* Subcommand Options. These options control the behavior of the
subcommand, not the `asadmin` utility. Subcommand options must follow
the subcommand. For a description of a subcommand's options, see the
entry for the subcommand in the
https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/doc/5.0/reference-manual.pdf[GlassFish
Server Open Source Edition Reference Manual].
+

[NOTE]
====
Not all subcommand options are supported for this release of GlassFish
Server. If you specify an unsupported option, a syntax error does not
occur. Instead, the command runs successfully and the unsupported option
is silently ignored.
====


A subcommand option may have the same name as an `asadmin` utility
option, but the effects of the two options are different.

Options have a long form and a short form.

* The short form of an option has a single dash (`-`) followed by a
single character.
* The long form of an option has two dashes (`--`) followed by an option
word.

For example, the short form and the long form of the option for
specifying terse output are as follows:

* Short form: `-t`
* Long form: `--terse`

Most options require argument values, except Boolean options, which
toggle to enable or disable a feature.

[[ghvyj]][[GSADG00633]][[operands-of-asadmin-utility-subcommands]]

Operands of `asadmin` Utility Subcommands
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Operands specify the items on which the subcommand is to act. Operands
must follow the argument values of subcommand options, and are set off
by a space, a tab, or double dashes (`--`). The `asadmin` utility treats
anything that follows the subcommand options and their values as an
operand.

[[ghvzx]][[GSADG00304]][[to-run-an-asadmin-utility-subcommand-in-single-mode]]

To Run an `asadmin` Utility Subcommand in Single Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In single mode, you must type a separate `asadmin` command for each
subcommand that you want to use. After the subcommand has run, you are
returned to the operating system's command shell. Any `asadmin` utility
options must be specified in each separate `asadmin` command that you
run. If you require the same `asadmin` utility options for multiple
subcommands, use the `asadmin` utility in multimode. For more
information, see link:#giodz[To Start a Multimode Session].

1. In the operating system's command shell, run the `asadmin` utility,
specifying the subcommand.
2. If necessary, also specify any required `asadmin` utility options,
subcommand options, and operands.

[[GSADG00098]][[giwdr]]
Example 2-1 Running an `asadmin` Utility Subcommand in Single Mode

This example runs the link:../reference-manual/list-applications.html#GSRFM00148[`list-applications`] subcommand
in single mode. In this example, the default values for all options are
used.

The example shows that the application `hello` is deployed on the local
host.

[source]
----
asadmin list-applications
hello <web>
Command list-applications executed successfully.
----

[[GSADG00099]][[giwbf]]
Example 2-2 Specifying an `asadmin` Utility Option With a Subcommand in
Single Mode

This example specifies the `--host` `asadmin` utility option with the
`list-applications` subcommand in single mode. In this example, the DAS
is running on the host `srvr1.example.com`.

The example shows that the applications `basic-ezcomp`, `scrumtoys`,
`ejb31-war`, and `automatic-timer-ejb` are deployed on the host
`srvr1.example.com`.

[source]
----
asadmin --host srvr1.example.com list-applications

[[givlw]][[GSADG00305]][[to-display-help-information-for-the-asadmin-utility-or-a-subcommand]]

To Display Help Information for the `asadmin` Utility or a Subcommand
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GlassFish Server provides help information about the syntax, purpose,
and options of the `asadmin` utility and its subcommands. This help
information is written in the style of UNIX platform man pages. This
help information is also available in the link:../reference-manual/toc.html#GSRFM[GlassFish Server
Open Source Edition Reference Manual].

1. If you are displaying help information for a remote subcommand,
ensure that the server is running.
+
Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Specify the subcommand of interest as the operand of the `help`
subcommand.
+
If you run the `help` subcommand without an operand, help information
for the `asadmin` utility is displayed.

To display the available subcommands, use the
link:../reference-manual/list-commands.html#GSRFM00154[`list-commands`] subcommand. Local subcommands are
displayed before remote subcommands. If the server is not running, only
local subcommands are displayed.

[[giodz]][[GSADG00306]][[to-start-a-multimode-session]]

To Start a Multimode Session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `asadmin` utility can be used in multiple command mode, or
multimode. In multimode, you run the `asadmin` utility once to start a
multimode session. During the session, the `asadmin` utility continues
to accept subcommands until you end the session and return to the
operating system's command shell. Any `asadmin` utility options that you
set for your multimode session are used for all subsequent subcommands
in the session.


[NOTE]
====
Starting a multimode session does not require a running DAS.
====

1. Do one of the following:
* Run the `asadmin` utility without a subcommand.
* Use the link:../reference-manual/multimode.html#GSRFM00213[`multimode`] subcommand.
2. If necessary, also specify any `asadmin` utility options that will
apply throughout the multimode session.
3. In a multimode session, the `asadmin>` prompt is displayed on the
command line. You can now type `asadmin` subcommands at this prompt to
administer GlassFish Server.

[[GSADG00103]][[givuq]]
Example 2-6 Starting a Multimode Session With `asadmin` Utility Options

This example starts a multimode session in which the `asadmin` utility
options `--user` and `--passwordfile` are set for the session.

[[GSADG00104]][[giwgh]]
Example 2-7 Starting a Multimode Session by Using the `multimode`
Subcommand

This example uses the `multimode` subcommand to start a multimode
session in which the default `asadmin` utility options are used.

[source]
----

Command list-domains executed successfully.
asadmin>
----

[[GSADG801]]

Starting a Multimode Session From Within an Existing Multimode Session

You can start a multimode session from within an existing session by
running the `multimode` subcommand from within the existing session.
After you end the second multimode session, you return to your original
multimode session.

[[GSADG802]]

See Also

You can also view the full syntax and options of the subcommand by
typing `asadmin help multimode` at the command line.

[[givjn]][[GSADG00307]][[to-end-a-multimode-session]]

To End a Multimode Session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the `asadmin>` prompt, type one of the following commands or key
combinations:

* `exit`
* `quit`
* UNIX and Linux systems: Ctrl-D
* Windows systems: Ctrl-Z


[CAUTION]
====
Do not type Ctrl-C to end a multimode session. If a domain or GlassFish
Server instance is started from the multimode session, typing Ctrl-C
kills the domain or instance process.
====


You are returned to the operating system's command shell and the
`asadmin>` prompt is no longer displayed. If the `asadmin>` prompt is
still displayed, you might have opened a multimode session within a
multimode session. In this situation, repeat this procedure to end the
remaining multimode session.

[[givjd]][[GSADG00308]][[to-run-a-set-of-asadmin-subcommands-from-a-file]]

To Run a Set of `asadmin` Subcommands From a File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Running a set of `asadmin` subcommands from a file enables you to
automate repetitive tasks.

1. Create a plain text file that contains the sequence of subcommands
that you want to run.
2. Run the link:../reference-manual/multimode.html#GSRFM00213[`multimode`] subcommand, specifying the
file that you created.
+
If necessary, also specify any `asadmin` utility options that are
required to enable subcommands in the file to run.

[[GSADG00106]][[givul]]
Example 2-9 Running a Set of `asadmin` Subcommands From a File

This example contains the following:

* A listing of a file that is named `commands_file.txt`, which contains
a sequence of `asadmin` subcommands
* The command to run the subcommands in the file `commands_file.txt`

The `commands_file.txt` file contains the `asadmin` utility subcommands
to perform the following sequence of operations:

1. Creating the domain `customdomain`
2. Starting the domain `customdomain`
3. Listing all available subcommands
4. Stopping the domain `customdomain`
5. Deleting the domain `customdomain`

The content of the `commands_file.txt` file is as follows:

[source]
----
create-domain --portbase 9000 customdomain
start-domain customdomain
list-commands
stop-domain customdomain
delete-domain customdomain
----

This example runs the sequence of subcommands in the `commands_file.txt`
file. Because the `--portbase` option is specified for the
`create-domain` subcommand in the file, the `--port` `asadmin` utility
option must also be set.

[source]
----
asadmin --port 9048 multimode --file commands_file.txt
----

[[GSADG803]]

[[CACDDHBA]][[GSADG1055]][[to-run-asadmin-subcommands-in---detach-mode]]

To Run `asadmin` Subcommands in `--detach` Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the `--detach` option of the `asadmin` utility to detach
`asadmin` subcommands and run them in the background in detach mode. The
`asadmin` `--detach` option is useful for long-running subcommands and
enables you to run several independent subcommands from one console or
script.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote commands require a running server.
2. Detach and run the subcommand by using the `asadmin` `--detach` option.

[[GSADG1056]][[sthref7]]
Example 2-10 Using the `--detach` Option in Single Mode

This example uses the `asadmin` `--detach` option in single mode to run
the `create-cluster` subcommand.

[source]
----
asadmin --detach create-cluster Cluster1
Job ID: 1
Command create-cluster started successfully.
----

[[GSADG1057]][[sthref8]]
Example 2-11 Using the `--detach` Option in Multimode

This example uses the `asadmin` `--detach` option in multimode to run
the `create-cluster` subcommand.

[source]
----
asadmin> create-cluster Cluster1 --detach
Job ID: 1
Command create-cluster started successfully.
----

Job IDs are assigned to subcommands that are started using the `asadmin`
`--detach` option or that contain progress information. You can use the
`list-jobs` subcommand to list jobs and their job IDs, the `attach`
subcommand to reattach to a job and view its status, and the
`configure-managed-jobs` subcommand to configure how long information
about jobs is kept.

[[GSADG1058]][[sthref9]]
Example 2-12 Listing Jobs

This example runs the `list-jobs` subcommand in multimode to list jobs
and job information.

[source]
----

1          create-cluster    COMPLETED   SUCCESS   2013-02-15 16:16:16 PST
2          deploy            COMPLETED   FAILURE   2013-02-15 18:26:30 PST
Command list-jobs executed successfully
----

[[GSADG1059]][[sthref10]]
Example 2-13 Attaching to a Subcommand and Checking Its Status

This example runs the `attach` subcommand in multimode to attach to the
`create-cluster` subcommand with a job ID of `1`. If a subcommand is
still in progress, the output displays the current status, such as
percentage complete.

[source]
----
asadmin> attach 1
Command create-cluster executed with status SUCCESS.
Command attach executed successfully.
----

[[GSADG1060]][[sthref11]]
Example 2-14 Configuring Managed Jobs

This example runs the `configure-managed-jobs` subcommand in multimode
to set the job retention period to 36 hours. Time periods can be
specified in Hh|Mm|Ss for hours, minutes, or seconds.

[source]
----

[[CHDJBJDA]][[GSADG1096]][[using-configuration-modularity]]

Using Configuration Modularity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With configuration modularity in GlassFish Server Open Source Edition,
new modules can be added to GlassFish Server distributions without
modifying the global `domain.xml` configuration file. Default
configuration data for modules is stored in the modules themselves,
rather than in `domain.xml`, and loaded when needed.

Module configuration elements are stored in `domain.xml` only when the
default configuration included in the module is changed or when module
configuration elements are added to `domain.xml` using the
`create-module-config` subcommand. The `delete-module-config` subcommand
removes module configuration elements from `domain.xml`, and the
`get-active-module-config` subcommand displays the current active
configuration of a module.

[[CHDGCJCF]][[GSADG1097]][[to-add-the-default-configuration-of-a-module-to-domain.xml]]

To Add Resources From an XML File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the `add-resources` subcommand in remote mode to create the
resources named in the specified XML file. The following resources are
supported: JDBC connection pool and resource, JMS, JNDI, and JavaMail
resources, custom resource, connector resource and work security map,
admin object, and resource adapter configuration.

The XML file must reside in the domain-dir`/config` directory. If you
specify a relative path or simply provide the name of the XML file, this
subcommand will prepend domain-dir`/config` to this operand.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Add resources from an XML file by using the
link:../reference-manual/add-resources.html#GSRFM00001[`add-resources`] subcommand.

Using REST Interfaces to Administer GlassFish Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GlassFish Server provides representational state transfer (REST)
interfaces to enable you to access monitoring and configuration data for
GlassFish Server, including data that is provided by newly installed
add-on components.

You can access the GlassFish Server REST interfaces through client
applications such as:

* Web browsers
* http://curl.haxx.se/[cURL]
* http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/[GNU Wget]

You can also use the GlassFish Server REST interfaces in REST client
applications that are developed in languages such as:

* JavaScript
* Ruby
* Perl
* Java
* JavaFX

The implementation of the GlassFish Server REST interfaces is based on
https://jersey.github.io[project Jersey] . Project Jersey is the
reference implementation of http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=311[Java
Specification Request (JSR) 311: JAX-RS: The Java API for RESTful Web
Services]. Information about JSR 311 is also available from the JSR
https://javaee.github.io/jsr311/[311 project home page] .

[[gjipk]][[GSADG00707]][[using-rest-urls-to-administer-glassfish-server]]

Using REST URLs to Administer GlassFish Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each object in the configuration and monitoring object trees is
represented as a REST resource that is accessible through an HTTP
uniform resource locator (URL). Access to REST resources for GlassFish
Server monitoring and configuration data requires a running DAS.

[[gkwhy]][[GSADG00634]][[rest-urls-to-resources-for-configuration-and-monitoring-objects]]

REST URLs to Resources for Configuration and Monitoring Objects
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The formats of the URLs to resources that represent objects in the
configuration and monitoring object trees are as follows:

* Configuration: `http://`host`:`port`/management/domain/`path
* Monitoring: `http://`host`:`port`/monitoring/domain/`path

The replaceable items in these URLs are as follows:

host::
  The host where the DAS is running.
port::
  The HTTP port or HTTPS port for administration.
path::
  The path to the object. The path is the dotted name of the object in
  which each dot (`.`) is replaced with a slash (`/`).
+

[NOTE]
====
The path to a GlassFish Server instance is ``servers/server/``instance-name,
where instance-name is the name of the instance.
For the DAS, instance-name is `server` and the path is `servers/server/server`.
====

For more information, see the following documentation:

* The link:../reference-manual/dotted-names.html#GSRFM00268[`dotted-names`(5ASC)] help page
* link:monitoring.html#ghbaz[How the Monitoring Tree Structure Works]
* link:overview.html#giusb[How Dotted Names Work for Configuration]

If the URL to a REST resource for GlassFish Server monitoring or
configuration data is opened in a web browser, the browser displays a
web page that contains the following information about the resource:

* A list of the attributes of the resource and their values. If the
resource represents an object in the configuration tree, these
attributes are presented in an HTML form that you can use to update the
resource. Attributes of a resource for an object in the monitoring tree
are read only.
* A list of hypertext links to the children of the resource. This list
of links enables you to traverse the tree that contains the resource and
to discover the all resources in the tree.
* A list of hypertext links to resources that represent `asadmin`
subcommands for non-CRUD operations on the resource.

The following figure shows the web page for the REST resource for
managing a domain.

[[GSADG00001]][[gjjce]]

[[gkwib]][[GSADG00635]][[rest-urls-for-accessing-the-log-file]]

REST URLs for Accessing the Log File
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `server.log` file of the DAS is represented as a child that is named
`view-log` of the resource for managing the domain. A child of the
resource for the `server.log` file represents the log file details

The formats of the URLs to resources that represent the log file are as
follows:

* Log file: `http://`host`:`port`/management/domain/view-log`
* Log file details:
`http://`host`:`port`/monitoring/domain/view-log/details`

The replaceable items in these URLs are as follows:

host::
  The host where the DAS is running.
port::
  The HTTP port or HTTPS port for administration.

You can use the optional `start` parameter in the URL to the resource
for the log file to specify the number of characters at the start of the
file to skip. For example, to skip 10,000 characters, specify the URL as
`http://localhost:4848/management/domain/view-log?start=10000`. This
example assumes that the DAS is running on the local host and uses the
default port for administration.

The resource for the log file returns the HTTP header
`"X-Text-Append-Next"`, which contains the entire URL to pass to the
`GET` method to return the changes since the last call. You can use this
header in client applications to get all log entries that were added in
particular interval. For example, by testing the value of the
`"X-Text-Append-Next"` header in a client thread every 10 seconds, you
can monitor the log entries that were added in the last 10 seconds.

[[gjijx]][[GSADG00708]][[using-rest-resource-methods-to-administer-glassfish-server]]

Using REST Resource Methods to Administer GlassFish Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GlassFish Server REST interfaces support methods for accessing
objects in the monitoring and configuration object trees.

The following table shows the REST methods for administering monitoring
and configuration data and the tasks that you can perform with each
method. These methods are HTTP 1.1 primitives. For the detailed
specification of these primitives, see
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html[Hypertext Transfer
Protocol -- HTTP/1.1] .

[[GSADG816]][[sthref16]][[gkame]]

Configuration Data

[width="100%",cols="74%,26%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Task |REST Method
|Determine the methods and method parameters that an object in the tree

|Retrieve data for an object in the tree |`GET`

|Add an object to the tree |`POST`

|Update an object in the tree |`POST`

|Delete an object from the tree |`DELETE`
|=======================================================================



[NOTE]
====
REST requests that add, update, or delete objects must specify the
`X-Requested-By` header with the value `GlassFish REST HTML interface`.

The `GET` method determines the methods and method parameters that an
object in the tree supports and provides additional information about
the object. For details, see link:#gjjel[To Retrieve Data for an Object
in the Tree].
====


[[gjjei]][[GSADG00324]][[to-determine-the-methods-and-method-parameters-that-an-object-in-the-tree-supports]]

To Determine the Methods and Method Parameters That an Object in the Tree Supports
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The methods and method parameters that an object in the tree supports
depend on the REST resource that represents the object:

* REST resources for monitoring support only the `GET` method.
* All REST resources for configuration support the `GET` method.
However, only some REST resources for configuration also support the
`POST` method and the `DELETE` method.

Before performing any operations on an object in the tree, determine the
methods and method parameters that the object supports.

You can specify the format in which this information is presented. For
more information, see link:#gjijz[Formats for Resource Representation of
Configuration Objects].


[NOTE]
====
Each `POST` method and `DELETE` method that a REST resource supports has
an equivalent `asadmin` subcommand. The parameters of a `POST` method or
a `DELETE` method correspond to the options of the method's equivalent
`asadmin` subcommand. For information about the options of `asadmin`
subcommand, see the olink:GSRFM[GlassFish Server Open Source Edition
Reference Manual].
====


1. Ensure that the server is running.
+
Operations on REST resources for GlassFish Server data require a running
server.
2. Use the `GET` method on the REST resource that represents the
object.
+
The `GET` method returns the list of methods that the resource supports.
For each method, the list of acceptable message parameters or the list
of acceptable query parameters are returned.

[[GSADG00121]][[gjjdi]]
Example 2-29 Determining the Methods and Method Parameters That an
Object in the Tree Supports

This example uses the cURL utility to determine the methods and method
parameters that the resource for the node `sj01` supports. The example
uses the following options of the cURL utility:

* `-X` to specify that the `GET` method is used
* `-H` to specify that the resource is represented in JavaScript Object

In this example, the DAS is running on the local host and the HTTP port
for administration is 4848. The resource supports the `GET` method and
the `POST` method.

Resources for `asadmin` Subcommands That Perform Non-CRUD Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GlassFish Server REST interfaces also support operations other than
create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, for example:

* State management
* Queries
* Application deployment

These operations are supported through REST resources that represent the
`asadmin` subcommands for performing these operations. Each resource is
a child of the resource on which the operation is performed. The child
resources do not represent objects in the configuration object tree.

For example, the resource that represents a node provides child
resources for the following `asadmin` subcommands that perform non-CRUD
operations on the node:

* `ping-node-ssh`
* `update-node-config`
* `update-node-ssh`

[[gjiut]][[GSADG00710]][[securing-glassfish-server-rest-interfaces]]

Securing GlassFish Server REST Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GlassFish Server REST interfaces support the following
authentication schemes for securing the REST interfaces:

* Basic authentication over a secure connection
* Authentication by using session tokens

When security is enabled, you must specify `https` as the protocol in
the URLs to REST resources and provide a user name and password.

[[GSADG817]][[sthref17]]


[[setting-up-basic-authentication-over-a-secure-connection]]
Setting Up Basic Authentication Over a Secure Connection
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Setting up basic authentication over a secure connection to secure
GlassFish Server REST interfaces involves the following sequence of
tasks:

1. Adding an `admin-realm` user to the `asadmin` user group
2. Enabling Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

For information about how to perform these tasks from the command line,
see the following documentation:

* "link:../security-guide/user-security.html#GSSCG00110[To Create an Authentication Realm]" in GlassFish
Server Open Source Edition Security Guide
* "link:../security-guide/user-security.html#GSSCG00118[To Create a File User]" in GlassFish Server Open
Source Edition Security Guide
* link:http_https.html#ggnbj[To Configure an HTTP Listener for SSL]

For information about how to perform these tasks by using the
Administration Console, see the following topics in the Administration
Console online help:

* To Add a User to the Admin Realm
* To Edit SSL Settings for a Protocol

[[gkvtj]][[GSADG00329]][[to-secure-rest-interfaces-by-using-session-tokens]]

To Secure REST Interfaces by Using Session Tokens
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Basic authentication requires a REST client to cache a user's
credentials to enable the client to pass the credentials with each
request. If you require a REST client not to cache credentials, your
client must use session tokens for authentication.

1. Request a session token by using the `GET` method on the resource at
`http://`host`:`port`/management/sessions`.
GlassFish Server uses basic authentication to authenticate the client,
generates a session token, and passes the token to the client.

2. In each subsequent request that requires authentication, use the
token to authenticate the client.
.. Create a cookie that is named `gfresttoken` the value of which is the token.
.. Send the cookie with the request.
.. When the token is no longer required, retire the token by using the
`DELETE` method on the resource at
`http://`host`:`port`/management/sessions/{`tokenvalue`}`.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a client does not explicitly retire a token, the token is retired
after 30 minutes of inactivity.

Formats for Resource Representation of Configuration Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GlassFish Server REST interfaces represent resources for
configuration objects in the following formats:

* http://www.json.org/[JSON]
* XML
* HTML

GlassFish Server enables you to specify the resource representation
through the filename extension in the URL or through the HTTP header:

* To specify the resource representation through the filename extension
in the URL, specify the appropriate extension as follows:

** For JSON, specify the `.json` extension.

** For XML, specify the `.xml` extension.

** For HTML, omit the extension.
* How to specify the resource representation through the HTTP header
depends on the client that you are using to access the resource. For
example, if you are using the cURL utility, specify the resource
representation through the `-H` option as follows:

** For JSON, specify `-H "Accept: application/json"`.

** For XML, specify `-H "Accept: application/xml"`.

** For HTML, omit the `-H` option.

HTML Resource Representation for Configuration Objects
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The format for the HTML representation of a resource for a configuration
object is a web page that provides the following information about the
resource:

* A list of the attributes of the resource and their values.
* A list of the methods and method parameters that the resource
supports. Each method and its parameters are presented as a field of the
appropriate type in an HTML form.
* A list of hypertext links to the children of the resource.
* A list of hypertext links to resources that represent `asadmin`
subcommands for non-CRUD operations on the resource.

For a sample web page, see link:#gjjce[Figure 2-1]. In this example, the
DAS is running on the local host and the HTTP port for administration is
4848. The URL to the resource in this example is
`http://localhost:4848/management/domain/nodes/node/sj01`.

XML Resource Representation for Log File Details
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The general format for the XML representation of a resource for log file
details is as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<records>
 records
 </records>
----

The replaceable item in this format is the records, which is one or more
XML elements that represent the log records in the log file. For the
format of each element, see link:#gkwot[XML Representation of a Log
Record].

XML Representation of a Log Record

The XML representation of a log record is as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<record loggedDateTimeInMS="logged-date" loggedLevel="log-level"
 loggerName="logger-class-name" messageID="message-id"
 nameValuePairs="_ThreadID=thread-id;_thread-name;" productName="product-name"
 recordNumber="record-number"/>
----

The replaceable items in this format are as follows:

logged-date::
  The date and time in UNIX time that the record was created.
log-level::
  The severity level of the message in the log record. For more
  information, see link:logging.html#gklml[Setting Log Levels].
logger-class-name::
  The fully qualified name of the Java class of the logger class that
  created the log message. Each component of GlassFish Server provides
  its own logger class. For detailed information about the names of
  logger classes in GlassFish Server, see link:logging.html#gkres[Logger
  Namespaces].
message-id::
  A unique identifier for the message. For messages from GlassFish
  Server, this identifier consists of a module code and a numerical
  value, for example, `CORE5004`. All `SEVERE` and `WARNING` messages
  and some `INFO` messages from GlassFish Server contain a message
  identifier. For more information, see the link:../error-messages-reference/toc.html#GSEMR[GlassFish Server
  Open Source Edition Error Message Reference].
thread-id::
  The numerical identifier of the thread that created the message.
thread-name::
  The name of the thread that created the message.
product-name::
  The application that created the log message, for example,
  `glassfish3.1`.
record-number::
  A serial number in the form of a decimal integer that uniquely
  identifies the log record.

Example XML Resource Representation for Log File Details

This example shows the XML representation of the resource for log file
details. In this example, the DAS is running on the local host and the
HTTP port for administration is 4848. The URL to the resource in this
example is `http://localhost:4848/management/domain/view-log/details`.

Line breaks and white space are added to enhance readability.

Supported Content Types in Requests to REST Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GlassFish Server REST interfaces support the following types in the
content-type header of a client request:

* http://www.json.org/[JSON]
* XML
* http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1[Form URL
encoded]

How to specify the type in the content-type header depends on how you
are sending the request. For example, if you are using the cURL utility,
specify the type through the `-H` option as follows:

* For JSON, specify `-H "Content-type: application/json"`.
* For XML, specify `-H "Content-type: application/xml"`.
* For form URL encoded, specify
`-H "Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"`.
