Description

The `create-jms-resource` subcommand creates a Java Message Service
(JMS) connection factory resource or a JMS destination resource.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only. Remote `asadmin`
subcommands require a running domain administration server (DAS).

[[sthref354]]

Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these
  options, see the link:asadmin.html#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--restype`::
  The JMS resource type, which can be `jakarta.jms.Topic`,
  `jakarta.jms.Queue`, `jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory`,
  `jakarta.jms.TopicConnectionFactory`, or
  `jakarta.jms.QueueConnectionFactory`.
`--target`::
  Creates the JMS resource only for the specified target. Valid values
  are as follows: +

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|=======================================================================
a|
Note:

The resource is always created for the domain as a whole, but the
`<resource-ref>` element for the resource is only created for the
specified `--target`. This means that although the resource is defined
at the domain level, it is only active at the specified `--target`.

|=======================================================================

  `server`;;
    Creates the JMS resource for the default server instance. This is
    the default value.
  `domain`;;
    Creates the JMS resource for the domain.
  cluster-name;;
    Creates the JMS resource for every server instance in the specified
    cluster.
  instance-name;;
    Creates the JMS resource for the specified server instance.
`--enabled`::
  If set to true (the default), the resource is enabled at runtime.
`--description`::
  Text providing details about the JMS resource.
`--property`::
  Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the JMS resource. +
  You can specify the following properties for a connection factory
  resource: +
  `ClientId`;;
    A client ID for a connection factory that will be used by a durable
    subscriber.
  `AddressList`;;
    A comma-separated list of message queue addresses that specify the
    host names (and, optionally, port numbers) of a message broker
    instance or instances with which your application will communicate.
    For example, the value could be `earth` or `earth:7677`. Specify the
    port number if the message broker is running on a port other than
    the default (7676). The default value is an address list composed
    from the JMS hosts defined in the server's JMS service
    configuration. The default value is `localhost` and the default port
    number is 7676. The client will attempt a connection to a broker on
    port 7676 of the local host.
  `UserName`;;
    The user name for the connection factory. The default value is
    `guest`.
  `Password`;;
    The password for the connection factory. The default value is
    `guest`.
  `ReconnectEnabled`;;
    A value of `true` indicates that the client runtime attempts to
    reconnect to a message server (or the list of addresses in the
    `AddressList`) when a connection is lost. The default value is
    `false`.
  `ReconnectAttempts`;;
    The number of attempts to connect (or reconnect) for each address in
    the `AddressList` before the client runtime tries the next address
    in the list. A value of -1 indicates that the number of reconnect
    attempts is unlimited (the client runtime attempts to connect to the
    first address until it succeeds). The default value is 6.
  `ReconnectInterval`;;
    The interval in milliseconds between reconnect attempts. This
    applies to attempts on each address in the `AddressList` and for
    successive addresses in the list. If the interval is too short, the
    broker does not have time to recover. If it is too long, the
    reconnect might represent an unacceptable delay. The default value
    is 30,000 milliseconds.
  `AddressListBehavior`;;
    Specifies whether connection attempts are in the order of addresses
    in the `AddressList` (`PRIORITY`) or in a random order (`RANDOM`).
    `PRIORITY` means that the reconnect will always try to connect to
    the first server address in the `AddressList` and will use another
    one only if the first broker is not available. If you have many
    clients attempting a connection using the same connection factory,
    specify `RANDOM` to prevent them from all being connected to the
    same address. The default value is the `AddressListBehavior` value
    of the server's JMS service configuration.
  `AddressListIterations`;;
    The number of times the client runtime iterates through the
    `AddressList` in an effort to establish (or re-establish) a
    connection). A value of -1 indicates that the number of attempts is
    unlimited. The default value is -1. +
  Additionally, you can specify `connector-connection-pool` attributes
  as connector resource properties. For a list of these attributes, see
  "link:../application-deployment-guide/dd-elements.html#GSDPG00124[connector-connection-pool]" in GlassFish Server Open
  Source Edition Application Deployment Guide. +
  You can specify the following properties for a destination resource: +
  `Name`;;
    The name of the physical destination to which the resource will
    refer. The physical destination is created automatically when you
    run an application that uses the destination resource. You can also
    create a physical destination with the `create-jmsdest` subcommand.
    If you do not specify this property, the JMS service creates a
    physical destination with the same name as the destination resource
    (replacing any forward slash in the JNDI name with an underscore).
  `Description`;;
    A description of the physical destination.
`--force`::
  Specifies whether the subcommand overwrites the existing JMS resource
  of the same name. The default value is `false`.

[[sthref355]]

Operands

jndi_name::
  The JNDI name of the JMS resource to be created.

Examples

[[GSRFM497]][[sthref357]]

Example 1   Creating a JMS connection factory resource for durable
subscriptions

The following subcommand creates a connection factory resource of type
`jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory` whose JNDI name is
`jms/DurableConnectionFactory`. The `ClientId` property sets a client ID
on the connection factory so that it can be used for durable
subscriptions. The JNDI name for a JMS resource customarily includes the
`jms/` naming subcontext.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
asadmin> create-jms-resource --restype jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory
--description "connection factory for durable subscriptions"
--property ClientId=MyID jms/DurableConnectionFactory
Connector resource jms/DurableConnectionFactory created.
Command create-jms-resource executed successfully.
----

[[GSRFM498]][[sthref358]]

Example 2   Creating a JMS destination resource

The following subcommand creates a destination resource whose JNDI name
is `jms/MyQueue`. The `Name` property specifies the physical destination
to which the resource refers.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
asadmin> create-jms-resource --restype jakarta.jms.Queue
--property Name=PhysicalQueue jms/MyQueue
Administered object jms/MyQueue created.
Command create-jms-resource executed successfully.
----

Exit Status

0::

1::
