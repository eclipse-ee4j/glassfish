[[about-eis-connectivity]]

=== About EIS Connectivity

Enterprise information system (EIS) refers to any system that holds the
data of an organization. It can be a mainframe, a messaging system, a
database system, or an application. Connection resources are used by
applications and modules to access EIS software.)

The key elements of EIS connectivity are the following:

* Connector Module. A connector module, also called a resource adapter,
is a Jakarta EE component that enables applications to interact with EIS
software. A connector module is used by {productName} to implement
Java Message Service (JMS). Like other Jakarta EE modules, a connector
module is installed when it is deployed. For instructions on creating a
connector module, see "xref:application-development-guide.adoc#developing-connectors[Developing Connectors]" in
{productName} Application Development Guide.
* Connector Connection Pool. A connector connection pool is a group of
reusable connections for a particular EIS. A connector connection pool
is created when you specify the connector module that is associated with
the pool. For administration procedures, see xref:#administering-connector-connection-pools[Administering
Connector Connection Pools].
* Connector Resource. A connector resource is a program object that
provides an application with a connection to an EIS. A connector
resource is created when you specify its JNDI name and its associated
connection pool. The JNDI name of a connector resource for an EIS is
usually in the `java:comp/env/`eis-specific subcontext. For
administration procedures, see xref:#administering-connector-resources[Administering Connector
Resources].
* Connector Module Configuration. A connector module configuration is
the information that resides in the domain configuration file
(`domain.xml`) for the particular connector module (resource adapter).
For administration procedures, see xref:#administering-the-resource-adapter-configuration[Administering the
Resource Adapter Configuration].
* Connector Security Map. A connector security map associates the caller
identity of the application (principal or user group) to a suitable EIS
principal or group. For administration procedures, see
<<Administering Connector Security Maps>>.
* Connector Work Security Map. A connector work security map associates
the caller identity of the work submitted by the connector module
(resource adapter) EIS principal or EIS user group to a suitable
principal or user group in the {productName} security domain. For
administration procedures, see xref:#administering-connector-work-security-maps[Administering Connector Work
Security Maps].
* Administered Object. An administered object provides specialized
functionality for an application, such as providing access to a parser
that is specific to the connector module and its associated EIS. For
administration procedures, see xref:#administering-administered-objects[Administering Administered
Objects].

At runtime, the following sequence occurs when an application connects
to an EIS:

1. The application gets the connector resource (data source) associated
with the EIS by making a call through the JNDI API.
+
Using the JNDI name of the connector resource, the naming and directory
service locates the resource. Each EIS resource specifies a connector
connection pool.
2. Using the connector resource, the application gets an EIS
connection.
+
{productName} retrieves a physical connection from the connection
pool that corresponds to the EIS resource. The pool defines connection
attributes such as the EIS name, user name, and password.
3. After the EIS connection is established, the application can read,
modify, and add data to the EIS.
+
The application accesses the EIS information by making calls to the JMS
API.
4. When the application is finished accessing the EIS, the application
closes the connection and returns the connection to the connection pool.

[[administering-connector-connection-pools]]

=== Administering Connector Connection Pools

After a connector module has been deployed, you are ready to create a
connector connection pool for it.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<To Create a Connector Connection Pool>>
* <<To List Connector Connection Pools>>
* xref:#to-connect-to-ping-or-reset-flush-a-connector-connection-pool[To Connect to (Ping) or Reset (Flush) a Connector

[[to-create-a-connector-connection-pool]]

==== To Create a Connector Connection Pool

Use the `create-connector-connection-pool` subcommand in remote mode to
create a connector connection pool for a deployed connector module. When
you are building the connector connection pool, certain data specific to
the EIS will be required. The value in the mandatory
`--connectiondefintion` option provides the EIS info.

Multiple connector resources can specify a single connection pool.

Creating a connector connection pool is a dynamic event and does not
require server restart. However, there are some parameters that do
require server restart. See xref:overview.adoc#configuration-changes-that-require-restart[Configuration
Changes That Require Restart].

Before You Begin

Before creating the connector connection pool, the connector must be
installed.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Create the connector connection pool by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-connector-connection-pool[`create-connector-connection-pool`] subcommand.
+
Information about properties for the subcommand is included in this help
page.
3. If needed, restart the server.
+
Some properties require server restart. See
xref:overview.adoc#configuration-changes-that-require-restart[Configuration Changes That Require Restart]. If
your server needs to be restarted, see xref:domains.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart
a Domain].
4. You can verify that a connection pool is usable by using the
`ping-connection-pool` subcommand.
+
For instructions, see xref:jdbc.adoc#to-contact-ping-a-connection-pool[To Contact (Ping) a Connection
Pool].

[[administering-administered-objects]]

=== Administering Administered Objects

Packaged within a connector module, an administered object provides
specialized functionality for an application. For example, an
administered object might provide access to a parser that is specific to
the connector module and its associated EIS.

The following topics are addressed here:

* <<To Create an Administered Object>>
* <<To List Administered Objects>>
* <<To Update an Administered Object>>
* <<To Delete an Administered Object>>

[[to-create-an-administered-object]]

==== To Create an Administered Object

Use the `create-admin-object` subcommand to create an administered
object resource. When creating an administered object resource,
name-value pairs are created, and the object is associated to a JNDI
name.

Before You Begin

The resource adapter must be deployed before running this subcommand
(`jmsrar.rar`).

1. Create an administered object by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-admin-object[`create-admin-object`] subcommand.
+
Information about properties for the subcommand is included in this help
page.
2. If needed, restart the server.
+
Some properties require server restart. See
xref:overview.adoc#configuration-changes-that-require-restart[Configuration Changes That Require Restart]. If
your server needs to be restarted, see xref:domains.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart
a Domain].

[[giokx]]
Example 12-20 Creating an Administered Object

For this example, the `jakarta.jms.Queue` resource type is obtained from
the `ra.xml` file. The JNDI name of the new administered object is
`jms/samplequeue`.

[source]
----
asadmin> create-admin-object --restype jakarta.jms.Queue --raname jmsra
--description "sample administered object" --property Name=sample_jmsqueue jms/samplequeue
Command create-admin-object executed successfully

[[to-list-administered-objects]]

==== To List Administered Objects

Use the `list-admin-object` subcommand in remote mode to list the
existing administered objects.

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. List the administered objects by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-admin-objects[`list-admin-objects`] subcommand.

[[giokg]]
Example 12-21 Listing Administered Objects

This example lists the existing administered objects.

typing `asadmin help list-admin-object` at the command line.

[[to-update-an-administered-object]]

==== To Update an Administered Object

Use the `get` and `set` subcommands to view and change the values of the
administered objects properties.

1. List the administered objects by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#list-admin-objects[`list-admin-objects`] subcommand.
2. View the properties of the administered object by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#get[`get`] subcommand.
For example:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> get domain.resources.admin-object-resource.jms/samplequeue.*
----
3. Set the property of the administered object by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#set[`set`] subcommand.
For example:
+
[source]
----
asadmin> set domain.resources.admin-object-resource.jms/samplequeue.enabled=false
----
4. If needed, restart the server. Some properties require server restart.
See xref:overview.adoc#configuration-changes-that-require-restart[Configuration Changes That Require Restart].
If your server needs to be restarted, see xref:domains.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart a Domain].
