== recover-transactions

Manually recovers pending transactions

=== Synopsis

[source]
----
asadmin [asadmin-options] recover-transactions [--help]
[--transactionlogdir transaction_log_dir]
[--target target_server_name] server_name
----

=== Description

The `recover-transactions` subcommand manually recovers pending
transactions.

For an installation of multiple server instances, you can run the
`recover-transactions` subcommand from a surviving server instance to
recover transactions after a server failure. To use this subcommand in
this way, the following conditions must be met:

* Delegated transaction recovery is disabled.
* Transaction logs are stored on a shared file system or in a database
that is accessible to all server instances.

For a stand-alone server, do not use this subcommand to recover
transactions after a server failure. For a stand-alone server, the
`recover-transactions` subcommand can recover transactions only when a
resource fails, but the server is still running. If a stand-alone server
fails, only the full startup recovery process can recover transactions
that were pending when the server failed.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

=== Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these
  options, see the xref:asadmin.adoc#asadmin[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--transactionlogdir`::
  The location of the transaction logs for a server for which
  transaction recovery is requested. This option applies only if
  transaction logs are stored on a shared file system.
`--target`::
  The target server that performs the recovery for the server that is
  specified by the server_name operand. The target server should be
  running.
`--destination`::
  This option is deprecated. It works exactly as the `--target` option
  does.

=== Operands

server_name::
  For a stand-alone server, the value of this operand is typically
  `server`. Transactions are recovered only if a resource fails, but the
  server is still running.

+
For an installation of multiple server instances, the value of this
  operand is the name of the server for which the recovery is required.
  The in-flight transactions on this server will be recovered. If this
  server is running, recovery is performed by the same server. In this
  situation, the `--transactionlogdir` and `--target` options should be
  omitted. If the server is not running, the `--target` option is
  required, and the `--transactionlogdir` option is also required if
  transaction logs are stored on a shared file system.

=== Examples
