        org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.tck.config.PublicKeyAsJWKLocationURLTest.testKeyAsLocationUrl fetches a key from a deployed resource.
        
        By default it gets this key from http://localhost:8080/jwks/endp/publicKey4kAsJWKS?kid=publicKey4k
        
        We can configure the base URL via system property "mp.jwt.tck.jwks.baseURL", but it's not super easy to configure this neatly
        with the current war file as context root on the server. The easier approach is therefor to set the context root to something
        constant, as below. "/" happens to be the default assumed context root by the tests as well.
        
     -->
    <context-root>/</context-root>

    <!-- Mapping as required by one test -->
    <security-role-mapping>
        <role-name>Group1MappedRole</role-name>
        <group-name>group1</group-name>
    </security-role-mapping>

    <!-- Default one to one mapping stops when one role is mapped. Must therefor manually define all others:  -->
    <security-role-mapping>
        <role-name>Echoer</role-name>
        <group-name>Echoer</group-name>
    </security-role-mapping>
    
    <security-role-mapping>
        <role-name>Tester</role-name>
        <group-name>Tester</group-name>
    </security-role-mapping>
    
    <security-role-mapping>
        <role-name>Token2Role</role-name>
        <group-name>Token2Role</group-name>
    </security-role-mapping>
    
    <security-role-mapping>
        <role-name>group1</role-name>
        <group-name>group1</group-name>
    </security-role-mapping>
