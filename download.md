## Eclipse GlassFish 7.x

Eclipse GlassFish is an application server, implementing Jakarta EE. This release is corresponding with the Jakarta EE 10 specification, which is a major new feature release. Jakarta EE 10 requires JDK 11 as a minimum, but also works on JDK 17 and JDK 21.

GlassFish 7.0.23 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs. It compiles and runs on JDK 11 to JDK 23. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.

The key feature for this release is making SSH nodes work on the Windows operating system, and while at it improve the way they work on Linux. The team mainly focussed on this work, and a lot of effort went into it. We're really happy to have achieved the goal to have it fully working. Next to that some important fixes were done for logging and specifically a regression for the security principal was fixed.
