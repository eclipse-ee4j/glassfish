Description

The `install-node-ssh` subcommand installs \{product---name} software on
the hosts that are specified as the operand of the subcommand. This
subcommand requires secure shell (SSH) to be configured on the host
where the subcommand is run and on each host where the \{product---name}
software is being installed.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

This subcommand is equivalent to the
link:install-node.html#install-node-1[`install-node`(1)] subcommand. To
install \{product---name} software on hosts that use the Distributed
Component Object Model (DCOM) remote protocol, use the
link:install-node-dcom.html#install-node-dcom-1[`install-node-dcom`(1)]
subcommand.

=======================================================================


If necessary, the subcommand creates a ZIP archive of the
\{product---name} software from the installation where this subcommand
is run. The archive does not contain the `domains` directory or the
`nodes` directory. These directories are synchronized from the domain
administration server (DAS) when instances on nodes that represent the
hosts are created and started. The subcommand does not delete the
archive after installing the \{product---name} software from the archive
on the specified hosts.

If multiple hosts are specified, the configuration of the following
items is the same on all hosts:

* Base installation directory
* SSH port
* SSH user
* SSH key file

If the SSH key file does not exist on a host where the \{product---name}
software is to be installed, the subcommand runs interactively and
prompts for a password. To enable the subcommand to run
noninteractively, the following conditions must be met:

* The `--interactive` option of the
link:asadmin.html#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`(1M)] utility must be `false`.
* The `--passwordfile` option of the `asadmin` utility must specify a
password file.
* The password file must contain the `AS_ADMIN_SSHPASSWORD` entry.

The subcommand does not modify the configuration of the DAS.

This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these
  options, see the link:asadmin.html#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--archive`::
  The absolute path to the archive file of the \{product---name}
  software that is to be installed. If no archive file is specified, the
  subcommand creates an archive from the installation of
  \{product---name} software from which the subcommand is run. This
  archive is created in the home directory of the user that is running
  the command.
`--create`::
  Specifies whether the subcommand should create an archive file of the
  \{product---name} software to install. +
  `false`;;
    No archive file is created. The subcommand installs the software
    from the existing archive file that the `--archive` option specifies
    (default).
  `true`;;
    The subcommand creates an archive file from the installation of
    \{product---name} software from which the subcommand is run.
`--save`::
  Specifies whether the archive file from which the software is
  installed is saved after installation. +
  `false`;;
    The archive file is not saved. The subcommand deletes the file after
    installing the software (default).
  `true`;;
    The archive file is saved.
`--installdir`::
  The absolute path to the parent of the base installation directory
  where the \{product---name} software is to be installed on each host,
  for example, `/export/glassfish3/`. If the directory does not exist,
  the subcommand creates the directory. +
  The user that is running this subcommand must have write access to the
  specified directory. Otherwise, an error occurs. +
  To overwrite an existing an installation of the \{product---name}
  software, set the `--force` option to `true`. If the directory already
  contains an installation and the `--force` option is `false`, an error
  occurs. +
  The default is the parent of the base installation directory of the
  \{product---name} software on the host where this subcommand is run.
`--sshport`::
  The port to use for SSH connections to the host where the
  \{product---name} software is to be installed. The default is 22.
`--sshuser`::
  The user on the host where the \{product---name} software is to be
  installed that is to run the process for connecting through SSH to the
  host. The default is the user that is running this subcommand. To
  ensure that the DAS can read this user's SSH private key file, specify
  the user that is running the DAS process.
`--sshkeyfile`::
  The absolute path to the SSH private key file for user that the
  `--sshuser` option specifies. This file is used for authentication to
  the `sshd` daemon on the host. +
  The user that is running this subcommand must be able to reach the
  path to the key file and read the key file. +
  The default is a key file in the user's `.ssh` directory. If multiple
  key files are found, the subcommand uses the following order of
  preference: +
  1.  `id_rsa`
  2.  `id_dsa`
  3.  `identity`
`--force`::
  Specifies whether the subcommand overwrites an existing installation
  of the \{product---name} software in the directory that the
  `--installdir` option specifies. Possible values are as follows: +
  `false`;;
    The existing installation is not overwritten (default).
  `true`;;
    The existing installation is overwritten.

Operands

host-list::

  \{product---name} software is to be installed.
