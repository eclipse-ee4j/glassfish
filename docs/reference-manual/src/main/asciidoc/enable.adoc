This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

=== Operands

component_name::
  name of the component to be enabled. +
  The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows the
  name and is separated from the name by a colon (`:`). The version
  identifier must begin with a letter or number. It can contain
  alphanumeric characters plus underscore (`_`), dash (`-`), and period
  (`.`) characters. For more information about module and application
  versions, see "xref:application-deployment-guide.adoc#module-and-application-versions[
  Module and Application Versions]" in
  {productName} Application Deployment Guide. +
