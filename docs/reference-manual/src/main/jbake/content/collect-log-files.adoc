Description

The `collect-log-files` subcommand collects all available log files for
the domain administration server (DAS), the specified cluster, or the
specified \{product---name} instance and creates a single ZIP archive of
the log files. If a cluster is specified, the ZIP archive also contains
the log file for the DAS.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these
  options, see the link:asadmin.html#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
  Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--retrieve`::
  Specifies whether the ZIP archive is created in a directory other than
  the default directory. +
  By default the ZIP archive is created in the
  domain-dir`/collected-logs` directory. The ZIP file names are
  constructed from the specified target and timestamp, as follows: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
log_yyyy-mm-dd_hh-min-sec.zip

::
  Possible values are as follows: +
  `false`;;
    The ZIP archive will be created in the default directory. If
    omitted, the `--retrieve` option defaults to `false`.
  `true`;;
    The ZIP archive will be created in the directory that the
    retrievefilepath operand specifies. If retrievefilepath is omitted,
    the ZIP archive will be created in the default directory.
`--target`::
  Specifies the target for which log files will be collected. +
  Possible values are as follows: +
  `server`;;
    The log files will be collected for the DAS (default).
  instance-name;;
    The log files will be collected for the specified \{product---name}
    instance.
  cluster-name;;
    The log files will be collected for the specified cluster and the
    DAS.

Operands

retrievefilepath::
  The name of the directory in which the ZIP archive will be created. If

  default directory. If the `--retrieve` option is `false`, this operand
  is ignored.
