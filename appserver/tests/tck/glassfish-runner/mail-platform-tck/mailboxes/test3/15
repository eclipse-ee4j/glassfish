I wouldn't say that.

I would say something like 

  The Java Development Kit (JDK) provides a complete software development
  and execution environment for the Java language.

  Java was designed with simplicity in mind, and Java programs are binary 
  compatible on all systems, so it is simpler, easier, and faster than 
  programming in C++.

Don't believe everything you read on the web.
