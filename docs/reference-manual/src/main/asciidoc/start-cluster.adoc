Starts a cluster

=== Synopsis

[source]
----
asadmin [asadmin-options] start-cluster [--help]
[--autohadboverride={true|false}]
[--verbose={false|true}] cluster-name
----

=== Description

The `start-cluster` subcommand starts a cluster by starting all
{productName} instances in the cluster that are not already running.
This subcommand requires the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)
remote protocol or secure shell (SSH) to be configured on the host where
the domain administration server (DAS) is running and on all hosts where
instances in the cluster reside.

[NOTE]
====
If all instances reside on the same host as the DAS, DCOM or SSH is not
required. You might require to start a cluster in which instances reside
on hosts where DCOM or SSH is not configured that are remote from the
DAS. In this situation, run the
xref:start-local-instance.adoc#start-local-instance[`start-local-instance`(1)]
subcommand for each instance from the host where the instance resides.
====

You may run this subcommand from any host that can contact the DAS.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
