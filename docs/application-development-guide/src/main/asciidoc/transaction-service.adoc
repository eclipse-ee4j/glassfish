* xref:#using-non-transactional-connections[Using Non-Transactional Connections]

[[using-jdbc-transaction-isolation-levels]]

==== Using JDBC Transaction Isolation Levels

Not all database vendors support all transaction isolation levels
available in the JDBC API. The {productName} permits specifying any
isolation level your database supports. The following table defines
transaction isolation levels.

[[fvyoi]]

Table 15-1 Transaction Isolation Levels

[width="100%",cols="27%,28%,45%",options="header",]
|===
|Transaction Isolation Level |`getTransactionIsolation` Return Value
|Description
|`read-uncommitted` |`1` |Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom
reads can occur.

|`read-committed` |`2` |Dirty reads are prevented; non-repeatable reads
and phantom reads can occur.

|`repeatable-read` |`4` |Dirty reads and non-repeatable reads are
prevented; phantom reads can occur.

|`serializable` |`8` |Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom
reads are prevented.
|===


By default, the transaction isolation level is undefined (empty), and
the JDBC driver's default isolation level is used. You can specify the
transaction isolation level in the following ways:

* Select the value from the Transaction Isolation drop-down list on the
New JDBC Connection Pool or Edit Connection Pool page in the
Administration Console. For more information, click the Help button in
the Administration Console.
* Specify the `--isolationlevel` option in the
`asadmin create-jdbc-connection-pool` command. For more information, see
the xref:reference-manual.adoc#GSRFM[{productName} Reference Manual].
* Specify the `transaction-isolation-level` option in the `asadmin set`
command. For example:
+
[source]
----
asadmin set domain1.resources.jdbc-connection-pool.DerbyPool.transaction-isolation-level=serializable
----
For more information, see the xref:reference-manual.adoc#GSRFM[{productName} Reference Manual].

Note that you cannot call `setTransactionIsolation` during a
transaction.

You can set the default transaction isolation level for a JDBC
connection pool. For details, see "xref:administration-guide.adoc#to-create-a-jdbc-connection-pool[To Create a JDBC
Connection Pool]" in {productName} Administration
Guide.

To verify that a level is supported by your database management system,
test your database programmatically using the
`supportsTransactionIsolationLevel` method in
`java.sql.DatabaseMetaData`, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext();
DataSource ds = (DataSource)
ctx.lookup("jdbc/MyBase");
Connection con = ds.getConnection();
DatabaseMetaData dbmd = con.getMetaData();
if (dbmd.supportsTransactionIsolationLevel(TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE)
{ Connection.setTransactionIsolation(TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE); }
----

For more information about these isolation levels and what they mean,
see the JDBC API specification.

Setting or resetting the transaction isolation level for every
`getConnection` call can degrade performance. So by default the
isolation level is not guaranteed.

Applications that change the transaction isolation level on a pooled
connection programmatically risk polluting the JDBC connection pool,
which can lead to errors. If an application changes the isolation level,
enabling the `is-isolation-level-guaranteed` setting in the pool can
minimize such errors.

You can guarantee the transaction isolation level in the following ways:

* Check the Isolation Level Guaranteed box on the New JDBC Connection
Pool or Edit Connection Pool page in the Administration Console. For
more information, click the Help button in the Administration Console.
* Specify the `--isisolationguaranteed` option in the
`asadmin create-jdbc-connection-pool` command. For more information, see
the xref:reference-manual.adoc#GSRFM[{productName} Reference Manual].
* Specify the `is-isolation-level-guaranteed` option in the
`asadmin set` command. For example:
+
[source]
----
asadmin set domain1.resources.jdbc-connection-pool.DerbyPool.is-isolation-level-guaranteed=true
----
For more information, see the xref:reference-manual.adoc#GSRFM[{productName} Reference Manual].

[[using-non-transactional-connections]]

==== Using Non-Transactional Connections

You can specify a non-transactional database connection in any of these
ways:

* Check the Non-Transactional Connections box on the New JDBC Connection
Pool or Edit Connection Pool page in the Administration Console. The
default is unchecked. For more information, click the Help button in the
Administration Console.
* Specify the `--nontransactionalconnections` option in the
`asadmin create-jdbc-connection-pool` command. For more information, see
the xref:reference-manual.adoc#GSRFM[{productName} Reference Manual].
* Specify the `non-transactional-connections` option in the
`asadmin set` command. For example:
+
[source]
----
asadmin set domain1.resources.jdbc-connection-pool.DerbyPool.non-transactional-connections=true
----
For more information, see the xref:reference-manual.adoc#GSRFM[{productName} Reference Manual].
* Use the `DataSource` implementation in the {productName}, which
provides a `getNonTxConnection` method. This method retrieves a JDBC
connection that is not in the scope of any transaction. There are two
variants.
+
[source,java]
----
public java.sql.Connection getNonTxConnection() throws java.sql.SQLException

public java.sql.Connection getNonTxConnection(String user, String password)
   throws java.sql.SQLException
----
* Create a resource with the JNDI name ending in `__nontx`. This forces
all connections looked up using this resource to be non transactional.

Typically, a connection is enlisted in the context of the transaction in
which a `getConnection` call is invoked. However, a non-transactional
connection is not enlisted in a transaction context even if a
transaction is in progress.

The main advantage of using non-transactional connections is that the
overhead incurred in enlisting and delisting connections in transaction
contexts is avoided. However, use such connections carefully. For
example, if a non-transactional connection is used to query the database
while a transaction is in progress that modifies the database, the query
retrieves the unmodified data in the database. This is because the
in-progress transaction hasn't committed. For another example, if a
non-transactional connection modifies the database and a transaction
that is running simultaneously rolls back, the changes made by the
non-transactional connection are not rolled back.

Here is a typical use case for a non-transactional connection: a
component that is updating a database in a transaction context spanning
over several iterations of a loop can refresh cached data by using a
non-transactional connection to read data before the transaction
commits.

[[handling-transactions-with-enterprise-beans]]

=== Handling Transactions with Enterprise Beans

This section describes the transaction support built into the Enterprise
JavaBeans programming model for the {productName}.

As a developer, you can write an application that updates data in
multiple databases distributed across multiple sites. The site might use
EJB servers from different vendors.

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#flat-transactions[Flat Transactions]
* xref:#global-and-local-transactions[Global and Local Transactions]
* xref:#commit-options[Commit Options]
* xref:#bean-level-container-managed-transaction-timeouts[Bean-Level Container-Managed Transaction Timeouts]

[[flat-transactions]]

==== Flat Transactions

The Enterprise JavaBeans Specification, v3.0 requires support for flat
(as opposed to nested) transactions. In a flat transaction, each
transaction is decoupled from and independent of other transactions in
the system. Another transaction cannot start in the same thread until
the current transaction ends.

Flat transactions are the most prevalent model and are supported by most
commercial database systems. Although nested transactions offer a finer
granularity of control over transactions, they are supported by far
fewer commercial database systems.

[[global-and-local-transactions]]

==== Global and Local Transactions

Both local and global transactions are demarcated using the
javax.transaction.UserTransaction interface, which the client must use.
Local transactions bypass the XA commit protocol and are faster. For
more information, see xref:#the-transaction-manager-the-transaction-synchronization-registry-and-usertransaction[The Transaction Manager, the
Transaction Synchronization Registry, and `UserTransaction`].

[[commit-options]]

==== Commit Options

The EJB protocol is designed to give the container the flexibility to
select the disposition of the instance state at the time a transaction
is committed. This allows the container to best manage caching an entity
object's state and associating an entity object identity with the EJB
instances.

There are three commit-time options:

* Option A - The container caches a ready instance between transactions.
The container ensures that the instance has exclusive access to the
state of the object in persistent storage.
+
In this case, the container does not have to synchronize the instance's
state from the persistent storage at the beginning of the next
transaction.
+

[NOTE]
====
Commit option A is not supported for this {productName} release.
====

* Option B - The container caches a ready instance between transactions,
but the container does not ensure that the instance has exclusive access
to the state of the object in persistent storage. This is the default.
+
In this case, the container must synchronize the instance's state by
invoking `ejbLoad` from persistent storage at the beginning of the next
transaction.
* Option C - The container does not cache a ready instance between
transactions, but instead returns the instance to the pool of available
instances after a transaction has completed.
+
The life cycle for every business method invocation under commit option
C looks like this.
+
[source]
----
ejbActivate   ejbLoad   business method   ejbStore   ejbPassivate
----
If there is more than one transactional client concurrently accessing
the same entity, the first client gets the ready instance and subsequent
concurrent clients get new instances from the pool.

The `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` deployment descriptor has an element,
`commit-option`, that specifies the commit option to be used. Based on
the specified commit option, the appropriate handler is instantiated.

[[bean-level-container-managed-transaction-timeouts]]

==== Bean-Level Container-Managed Transaction Timeouts

The transaction timeout for the domain is specified using the
Transaction Timeout setting of the Transaction Service. A transaction
started by the container must commit (or rollback) within this time,
regardless of whether the transaction is suspended (and resumed), or the
transaction is marked for rollback. The default value, `0`, specifies
that the server waits indefinitely for a transaction to complete.

To override this timeout for an individual bean, use the optional
`cmt-timeout-in-seconds` element in `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml`. The default
value, `0`, specifies that the Transaction Service timeout is used. The
value of `cmt-timeout-in-seconds` is used for all methods in the bean
that start a new container-managed transaction. This value is not used
if the bean joins a client transaction.

[[handling-transactions-with-the-java-message-service]]

=== Handling Transactions with the Java Message Service

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#transactions-and-non-persistent-messages[Transactions and Non-Persistent Messages]
* xref:#using-the-configurabletransactionsupport-interface[Using the ConfigurableTransactionSupport Interface]

[[transactions-and-non-persistent-messages]]

==== Transactions and Non-Persistent Messages

During transaction recovery, non-persistent messages might be lost. If
the broker fails between the transaction manager's prepare and commit
operations, any non-persistent message in the transaction is lost and
cannot be delivered. A message that is not saved to a persistent store
is not available for transaction recovery.

[[using-the-configurabletransactionsupport-interface]]

==== Using the ConfigurableTransactionSupport Interface

The Jakarta EE Connector 1.6 specification allows a resource adapter to use
the `transaction-support` attribute to specify the level of transaction
support that the resource adapter handles. However, the resource adapter
vendor does not have a mechanism to figure out the current transactional
context in which a `ManagedConnectionFactory` is used.

If a `ManagedConnectionFactory` implements an optional interface called
com.sun.appserv.connectors.spi.ConfigurableTransactionSupport , the
{productName} notifies the `ManagedConnectionFactory` of the
`transaction-support` configured for the connector connection pool when
the `ManagedConnectionFactory` instance is created for the pool.
Connections obtained from the pool can then be used with a transaction
level at or lower than the configured value. For example, a connection
obtained from a pool that is set to `XA_TRANSACTION` could be used as a
LOCAL resource in a last-agent-optimized transaction or in a
non-transactional context.

[[the-transaction-manager-the-transaction-synchronization-registry-and-usertransaction]]

=== The Transaction Manager, the Transaction Synchronization Registry, and `UserTransaction`

To access a `UserTransaction` instance, you can either look it up using
the `java:comp/``UserTransaction` JNDI name or inject it using the
`@Resource` annotation.

Accessing a `DataSource` using the `Synchronization.beforeCompletion()`
method requires setting Allow Non Component Callers to `true`. The
default is `false`. For more information about non-component callers,
see xref:jdbc.adoc#allowing-non-component-callers[Allowing Non-Component Callers].

If possible, you should use the
javax.transaction.TransactionSynchronizationRegistry interface instead
of javax.transaction.TransactionManager , for portability. You can look
up the implementation of this interface by using the JNDI name
`java:comp/``TransactionSynchronizationRegistry`. For details, see the
https://jakarta.ee/specifications/transactions/2.0/apidocs/jakarta/transaction/transactionsynchronizationregistry[`TransactionSynchronizationRegistryInterface`]
API documentation and
http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=907[Java Specification Request (JSR) 907]

If accessing the javax.transaction.TransactionManager implementation is
absolutely necessary, you can look up the {productName}
implementation of this interface using the JNDI name
java:appserver/TransactionManager . This lookup should not be used by
the application code.
