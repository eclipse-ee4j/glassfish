Note:

Resources are always created for a domain as a whole but are only
active for targets for which a `<resource-ref>` has been created using
the `--target` option when the resource was created. This means that
deleting a resource only deletes the `<resource-ref>` element for the
specified `--target`, and does not delete the resource from the domain
as a whole unless `domain` is specified as the `--target` for the
deletion.

|=======================================================================
