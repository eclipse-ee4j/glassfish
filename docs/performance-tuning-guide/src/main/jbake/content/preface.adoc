[NOTE]
========================================================================

This documentation is part of the Java Enterprise Edition contribution 
to the Eclipse Foundation and is not intended for use in relation to 
Java Enterprise Edition or Orace GlassFish. The documentation is in the 
process of being revised to reflect the new Jakarta EE branding. 
Additional changes will be made as requirements and procedures evolve 
for Jakarta EE. Where applicable, references to Java EE or Java 
Enterprise Edition should be considered references to Jakarta EE. 

Please see the Title page for additional license information.

The Performance Tuning Guide describes how to get the best performance
with GlassFish Server 5.1.

This preface contains information about and conventions for the entire
Eclipse GlassFish Server (GlassFish Server) documentation
set.

GlassFish Server 5.1 is developed through the GlassFish project
open-source community at `http://glassfish.java.net/`. The GlassFish
project provides a structured process for developing the GlassFish
Server platform that makes the new features of the Java EE platform
available faster, while maintaining the most important feature of Java
EE: compatibility. It enables Java developers to access the GlassFish
Server source code and to contribute to the development of the GlassFish
Server. The GlassFish project is designed to encourage communication
between Oracle engineers and the community.
