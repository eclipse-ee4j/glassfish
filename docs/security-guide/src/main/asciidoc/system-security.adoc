=== About System Security in {productName}

Security is about protecting data, that is, how to prevent unauthorized
access or damage to data that is in storage or in transit. The {productName} is built on the Java security model, which uses a sandbox where
applications can run safely, without potential risk to systems or users.
System security affects all the applications in the {productName} environment.

The Jakarta EE Security API specification defines portable, plug-in
interfaces for authentication and identity stores, and a new
injectable-type SecurityContext interface that provides an access point
for programmatic security. You can use the built-in implementations of
the plug-in SPIs, or write custom implementations.

System security features include the following:

* xref:#authentication[Authentication]
* xref:#authorization[Authorization]
* xref:#auditing[Auditing]
* xref:#firewalls[Firewalls]
* xref:#certificates-and-ssl[Certificates and SSL]
* xref:#tools-for-managing-system-security[Tools for Managing System Security]

[[authentication]]

==== Authentication

Authentication is the way in which an entity (a user, an application, or
a component) determines that another entity is who it claims to be. An
entity uses security credentials to authenticate itself. The credentials
might be a user name and password, a digital certificate, or something
else. Usually, servers or applications require clients to authenticate
themselves. Additionally, clients might require servers to authenticate
themselves. When authentication is bidirectional, it is called mutual
authentication.

When an entity tries to access a protected resource, {productName}
uses the authentication mechanism configured for that resource to
determine whether to grant access. For example, a user can enter a user
name and password in a web browser, and if the application verifies
those credentials, the user is authenticated. The user is associated
with this authenticated security identity for the remainder of the session.

[[authentication-types]]

===== Authentication Types

Within its deployment descriptors, an application can specify the type
of authentication that it uses. The Jakarta EE Security API provides an
alternative mechanism for configuring the type of authentication an
application uses. See https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=375[Jakarta EE
Security API 1.0 specification]. {productName} supports specifying
the following types of authentication in deployment descriptors:

BASIC::
  Uses the standard Basic Authentication Scheme as described in RFC 2617.
  The communication protocol is HTTP (SSL optional). There is no
  encryption of user credentials unless using SSL. This type is not
  considered to be a secure method of user authentication unless used in
  conjunction with an encrypted communications channel, such as that
  provided by SSL.
FORM::
  The application provides its own custom login and error pages. The
  communication protocol is HTTP (SSL optional). There is no encryption
  of user credentials unless using SSL.
CLIENT-CERT::
  The server authenticates the client using a public key certificate.
  The communication protocol is HTTPS (HTTP over SSL).
DIGEST::
  The server authenticates a user based on a user name and a password.
  Unlike BASIC authentication, the plaintext password is never sent over
  the network, although a hash of the password combined with other
  parameters is sent. While Digest Authentication is more secure than
  Basic Authentication, user names and passwords are not strongly
  protected, and the use of SSL is still recommended.

[[jsr-375-authentication-mechanisms-and-identity-stores]]

===== JSR 375 Authentication Mechanisms and Identity Stores

The Jakarta EE Security API defines the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`
interface, the `IdentityStore` and `IdentityStoreHandler` interfaces.

The `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` interface defines an SPI for writing
authentication mechanisms that can be provided with an application and
deployed using CDI. Developers can write their own implementations of
`HttpAuthenticationMechanism` to support specific authentication token
types or protocols. There are also several built-in authentication
mechanisms that perform BASIC, FORM, and Custom FORM authentication.
The `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` interface defines three methods -
`validateRequest()`, `secureResponse()`, and `cleanSubject()`.
These methods align closely with the methods defined by the JASPIC
`ServerAuth` interface.

The `IdentityStore` interface provides an abstraction of an identity
store that holds user account information including name, password,
group membership, and potentially other attributes. Implementations of
the `IdentityStore` interface are used to validate caller credentials,
typically username and password, and retrieve and group information.
There are built-in implementations of this SPI that can validate
credentials against external LDAP or Database identity stores.

`IdentityStore` is intended primarily for use by
`HttpAuthenticationMechanism` implementations, but could be used by
other authentication mechanisms, such as a JASPIC `ServerAuthModule`, or
a container's built-in authentication mechanisms. Though
`HttpAuthenticationMechanism` implementations can authenticate users in
any manner they choose, the `IdentityStore` interface provides a
convenient mechanism. A significant advantage of using
`HttpAuthenticationMechanism` and `IdentityStore` over the declarative
mechanisms defined by the Servlet specification is that it allows an
application to control the identity stores that it authenticates
against, in a standard, portable way. You can use the built-in
implementations of the  plug-in SPIs, or define custom implementations.

[[jsr-196-server-authentication-modules]]

===== JSR 196 Server Authentication Modules

{productName} implements the Servlet Container Profile of
http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=196[JSR 196 Java Authentication
Service Provider Interface for Containers specification].

JSR 196 defines a standard service-provider interface (SPI) for
integrating authentication mechanism implementations in message
processing runtimes. JSR 196 extends the concepts of the Java
Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) to enable pluggability
of message authentication modules in message processing runtimes. The
standard defines profiles that establish contracts for the use of the
SPI in specific contexts.

[[passwords]]

===== Passwords

Passwords are your first line of defense against unauthorized access to
the components and data of {productName}. For Information about how
to use passwords for {productName}, see xref:#administering-passwords[Administering
Passwords].

[[master-password-and-keystores]]

====== Master Password and Keystores

The master password is not tied to a user account and it is not used for
authentication. Instead, {productName} uses the master password only
to encrypt the keystore and truststore for the DAS and instances.

When you create a new {productName} domain, a new self-signed
certificate is generated and stored in the domain keystore and
truststore. The DAS needs the master password to open these stores at
startup. Similarly, the associated server instances need the master
password to open their copy of these stores at startup.

If you use a utility such as keytool to modify the keystore or
truststore, you must provide the master password in that case as well.

The master password is a shared password and must be the same for the
DAS and all instances in the domain in order to manage the instances
from the DAS. However, because {productName} never transmits the
master password over the network, it is up to you to keep the master
password in sync between the DAS and instances.

If you change the master password, you can choose to enter the master
password manually when required, or save it in a file.

[[understanding-master-password-synchronization]]

====== Understanding Master Password Synchronization

The master password is used encrypt the keystore and truststore for the
DAS and instances. The DAS needs the master password to open these
stores at startup. Similarly, the associated server instances need the
master password to open their copy of these stores at startup.

{productName} keeps the keystore and truststore for the DAS and
instances in sync, which guarantees that all copies of the stores are
encrypted with the same master password at any given time.

However, {productName} does not synchronize the master password
itself, and it is possible that the DAS and instances might attempt to
use different master passwords.

Consider the following potential scenario:

1. You create a domain and instances, using the default master password
(changeit). As a result, the DAS and instances have keystores and
truststores encrypted using changeit.
2. You use the `change-master-password` subcommand on the DAS to change
the master password to ichangedit. As a result, the DAS and instance
keystores and truststores are encrypted using ichangedit.
3. Access to the keystore and truststore from an instance now requires
the master password ichangedit. You are responsible for changing the
master password as needed.

If you do not use a master password file, you assume the responsibility
for using the `change-master-password` subcommand on the DAS and
instances to keep the master passwords in sync. Be aware that not using
a master password file has additional considerations for the
start-instance and start-cluster subcommands, as described in
xref:#additional-considerations-for-the-start-instance-and-start-cluster-subcommands[Additional Considerations for the `start-instance` and
`start-cluster` Subcommands].

If you do use a master password file, you assume the responsibility for
using the `change-master-password` subcommand on the DAS and instances
to keep the master password file in sync.

[[using-the-default-master-password]]

====== Using the Default Master Password

{productName} uses the known phrase "changeit" as the default master
password. This master password is not stored in a file. The default
password is a convenience feature and provides no additional security
because it is assumed to be widely known.

All {productName} subcommands work as expected with the default
master password and there are no synchronization issues.

[[saving-the-master-password-to-a-file]]

====== Saving the Master Password to a File

The `change-master-password` `--savemasterpassword` option indicates
whether the master password should be written to the file system in the
`master-password` file for the DAS or a node. The default is false.

For a domain, the master password is kept in
domain-dir``/master-password``.

For a node, the master-password file is kept in
``nodes/``node-name``/agent/master-password``. You can set a master password
at the node level and all instances created on that node will use that
master-password file. To do this, use the `--nodedir` option and provide
a node name.

You might want to save the master password to the file so that the
`start-domain` subcommand can start the server without having to prompt
the user. There are additional considerations for using a master
password with the `start-instance` and `start-cluster` subcommands, as
described in xref:#additional-considerations-for-the-start-instance-and-start-cluster-subcommands[Additional Considerations for the
`start-instance` and `start-cluster` Subcommands].

The master-password file is encoded, not encrypted. You must use
filesystem permissions to protect the file.

[[using-the-master-password-when-creating-a-domain]]

====== Using the Master Password When Creating a Domain

The `create-domain` `--usemasterpassword` option specifies whether the
keystore is encrypted with a master password that is built into the
system, or by a user-defined master password.

* If false (default), the keystore is encrypted with a well-known
password (changeit) that is built into {productName}.
* If true, the subcommand obtains the master password from the
`AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD` entry in the password file you specified in
the `--passwordfile` option of the `asadmin` utility. Or, if none is
defined, `--usemasterpassword` prompts the user for the master password.

[[administration-password]]

====== Administration Password

An administration password, also known as the admin password, is used to
invoke the Administration Console and the `asadmin` utility. As with the
default admin username, the default admin password is usually set during
installation but it can be changed. For instructions, see xref:#to-change-an-administration-password[To
Change an Administration Password].

[[encoded-passwords]]

====== Encoded Passwords

Files that contain encoded passwords need to be protected using file
system permissions. These files include the following:

* domain-dir``/master-password``
+
This file contains the encoded master password and should be protected
with file system permissions 600.
* Any password file created to pass as an argument by using the
`--passwordfile` argument to the `asadmin` utility should be protected
with file system permissions. Additionally, any password file being used
for a transient purpose, such as setting up SSH among nodes, should be
deleted after it has served its purpose.

For instructions, see xref:#to-set-a-password-from-a-file[To Set a Password From a File].

[[web-browsers-and-password-storage]]

====== Web Browsers and Password Storage

Most web browsers can save login credentials entered through HTML forms.
This function can be configured by the user and also by applications
that employ user credentials. If the function is enabled, then
credentials entered by the user are stored on their local computer and
retrieved by the browser on future visits to the same application. This
function is convenient for users, but can also be a security risk. The
stored credentials can be captured by an attacker who gains access to
the computer, either locally or through some remote compromise. Further,
methods have existed whereby a malicious web site can retrieve the
stored credentials for other applications, by exploiting browser
vulnerabilities or through application-level cross-domain attacks.

To prevent your web browser from saving login credentials for the
{productName} Administration Console, choose "No" or "Never for this
page" when prompted by the browser during login.

[[password-aliases]]

===== Password Aliases

To avoid storing passwords in the domain configuration file in clear
text, you can create an alias for a password. This process is also known
as encrypting a password. For more information, see
xref:#administering-password-aliases[Administering Password Aliases].

[[single-sign-on]]

===== Single Sign-on

With single sign-on, a user who logs in to one application becomes
implicitly logged in to other applications that require the same
authentication information. Single sign-on is based on groups. Single
sign-on applies to web applications configured for the same realm and
virtual server. The realm is defined by the `realm-name` element in the
`web.xml` file.

On {productName}, single sign-on behavior can be inherited from the
HTTP Service, enabled, or disabled. By default, it is inherited from the
HTTP Service. If enabled, single sign-on is enabled for web applications
on this virtual server that are configured for the same realm. If
disabled, single sign-on is disabled for this virtual server, and users
must authenticate separately to every application on the virtual server.

[[authorization]]

==== Authorization

Authorization, also known as access control, is the means by which users
are granted permission to access data or perform operations. After a
user is authenticated, the user's level of authorization determines what
operations the owner can perform. A user's authorization is based on the
user's role.

[[roles]]

Roles
+++++

A role defines which applications and what parts of each application
users can access and what those users or groups can do with the
applications. For example, in a personnel application, all employees
might be able to see phone numbers and email addresses, but only
managers have access to salary information. This application would
define at least two roles: `employee` and `manager`. Only users in the
`manager` role are allowed to view salary information.

A role is different from a group in that a role defines a function in an
application, while a group is a set of users who are related in some
way. For example, the personnel application specify groups such as
`full-time`, `part-time`, and `on-leave`. Users in these groups are all
employees (the `employee` role). In addition, each user has its own
designation that defines an additional level of employment.

Roles are defined in the deployment descriptor for the application. The
application developer or deployer maps roles to one or more groups in
the deployment descriptor for each application. When the application is
being packaged and deployed, the application specifies mappings between
users, groups, and roles, as illustrated in xref:#fxjfw[Figure 1-1].

[NOTE]
====
By default, group principal names are mapped to roles of the same name.
Therefore, the Default Principal To Role Mapping setting is enabled by
default on the Security page of the {productName} Administration
Console. With this setting enabled, if the group name defined on
{productName} matches the role name defined in the application, there
is no need to use the runtime deployment descriptor to provide a
mapping. The application server will implicitly make this mapping, as
long as the names of the groups and roles match.
====

[[fxjfw]]

.*Figure 1-1 Role Mapping*
image:img/securityrolemapping.png[
"Figure shows how users are assigned to groups, how users and groups are
assigned to roles, and how applications use groups and roles."]


[[java-authorization-contract-for-containers]]

===== Java Authorization Contract for Containers

Java Authorization Contract for Containers (JACC) is the part of the
Jakarta EE specification that defines an interface for pluggable
authorization providers. This enables you to set up third-party plug-in
modules to perform authorization. By default, the {productName}
provides a simple, file-based authorization engine that complies with
the JACC specification.

This release includes Administration Console support and CLI subcommands
to create (`create-jacc-provider`), delete (`delete-jacc-provider`), and
list (`list-jacc-providers`) JACC providers. xref:#administering-jacc-providers[Administering
JACC Providers] for additional information.

You can also specify additional third-party JACC providers.

[[GSSCG00191]][[working-with-the-server.policy-policy-file]]

===== Working With the server.policy Policy File

Each {productName} domain has its own global Java SE policy file,
located in domain-dir``/config``. The file is named `server.policy`.

This section covers the following topics:

* xref:#GSSCG00050[Contents of server.policy]
* xref:#changing-the-default-permissions[Changing the Default Permissions]

[[GSSCG00050]][[contents-of-server.policy]]

Contents of server.policy

A sample server.policy file is as follows. Comments in the file describe
why various permissions are granted. These permissions are described in
more detail in the next section.

[[changing-the-default-permissions]]

====== Changing the Default Permissions

The {productName} internal server code is granted all permissions.
These grants are covered by the `AllPermission` grant blocks to various
parts of the server infrastructure code. Do not modify these entries.

Application permissions are granted in the default grant block. These
permissions apply to all code not part of the internal server code
listed previously.

The last section, beginning with the comment "Basic set of required
permissions..." provides the basic set of permissions granted to all
remaining code.

Depending on your {productName} implementation, deleting or modifying
these permissions might be appropriate.

Specifically, the following permission allows all applications to read
and write all properties and read and write all files on the filesystem.

[source]
----
permission java.util.PropertyPermission "*", "read,write";
permission java.io.FilePermission       "<<ALL FILES\>>", "read,write";
----

While this grant provides optimum flexibility, it is inherently
unsecure. For enhanced security, change this permission based on your
real deployment needs.

For example, consider removing this permission and assign default read
and write permissions only to the application's install directory
(context-root). (This example uses `com.sun.aas.instanceRoot`, which
specifies the top level directory for a server instance.)

[source]
----
grant codeBase "file:${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/applications/MyApp/-"
{
permission java.io.FilePermission "file:${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}
/applications/MyApp/-", "read,write";
}
----

For any application that needs to read and write additional directories,
you would then have to explicitly allow such permissions by adding
specific grants. In general, you should add extra permissions only to
the applications or modules that require them, not to all applications
deployed to a domain.

Additional permissions (see the embedded comments in `server.policy`)
are granted specifically for using connectors and reflection. If
connectors or reflection are not used in a particular domain, you should
remove these permissions, because they are otherwise unnecessary.

[[auditing]]

==== Auditing

Auditing is the means used to capture security-related events for the
purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of security measures. {productName} uses audit modules to capture audit trails of all authentication
and authorization decisions. {productName} provides a default audit
module, as well as the ability to plug in custom audit modules. The
scope of the audit module is the entire server, which means that all the
applications on the server will use the same audit module.

For administration instructions, see xref:#administering-audit-modules[Administering Audit
Modules].

[[firewalls]]

==== Firewalls

A firewall controls the flow of data between two or more networks, and
manages the links between the networks. A firewall can consist of both
hardware and software elements. The following guidelines pertain
primarily to {productName}:

* In general, firewalls should be configured so that clients can access
the necessary TCP/IP ports.
+
For example, if the HTTP listener is operating on port 8080, configure
the firewall to allow HTTP requests on port 8080 only. Likewise, if
HTTPS requests are set up for port 8081, you must configure the
firewalls to allow HTTPS requests on port 8081.
* If direct Remote Method Invocations over Internet Inter-ORB Protocol
(RMI-IIOP) access from the Internet to EJB modules is required, open the
RMI-IIOP listener port as well.
+

[NOTE]
====
Opening the RMI-IIOP listener port is strongly discouraged because it
creates security risks.
====

* In double firewall architecture, you must configure the outer firewall
to allow for HTTP and HTTPS transactions. You must configure the inner
firewall to allow the HTTP server plug-in to communicate with {productName} behind the firewall.

[[certificates-and-ssl]]

==== Certificates and SSL

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#certificates[Certificates]
* xref:#certificate-chains[Certificate Chains]
* xref:#certificate-files[Certificate Files]
* xref:#secure-sockets-layer[Secure Sockets Layer]
* xref:#custom-authentication-of-client-certificate-in-ssl-mutual-authentication[Custom Authentication of Client Certificate in SSL Mutual Authentication]

For administration instructions, see xref:#administering-jsse-certificates[Administering JSSE Certificates].

[[certificates]]

===== Certificates

Certificates, also called digital certificates, are electronic files
that uniquely identify people and resources on the Internet.
Certificates also enable secure, confidential communication between two
entities. There are different kinds of certificates:

* Personal certificates are used by individuals.
* Server certificates are used to establish secure sessions between the
server and clients through secure sockets layer (SSL) technology.

Certificates are based on public key cryptography, which uses pairs of
digital keys (very long numbers) to encrypt, or encode, information so
the information can be read only by its intended recipient. The
recipient then decrypts (decodes) the information to read it. A key pair
contains a public key and a private key. The owner distributes the
public key and makes it available to anyone. But the owner never
distributes the private key, which is always kept secret. Because the
keys are mathematically related, data encrypted with one key can only be
decrypted with the other key in the pair.

Certificates are issued by a trusted third party called a Certification
Authority (CA). The CA is analogous to a passport office: it validates
the certificate holder's identity and signs the certificate so that it
cannot be forged or tampered with. After a CA has signed a certificate,
the holder can present it as proof of identity and to establish
encrypted, confidential communications. Most importantly, a certificate
binds the owner's public key to the owner's identity.

In addition to the public key, a certificate typically includes
information such as the following:

* The name of the holder and other identification, such as the URL of
the web server using the certificate, or an individual's email address
* The name of the CA that issued the certificate
* An expiration date

Certificates are governed by the technical specifications of the X.509
format. To verify the identity of a user in the `certificate` realm, the
authentication service verifies an X.509 certificate, using the common
name field of the X.509 certificate as the principal name.

[[certificate-chains]]

===== Certificate Chains

A certificate chain is a series of certificates issued by successive CA
certificates, eventually ending in a root CA certificate.

Web browsers are preconfigured with a set of root CA certificates that
the browser automatically trusts. Any certificates from elsewhere must
come with a certificate chain to verify their validity.

When a certificate is first generated, it is a self-signed certificate.
A self-signed certificate is one for which the issuer (signer) is the
same as the subject (the entity whose public key is being authenticated
by the certificate). When the owner sends a certificate signing request
(CSR) to a CA, then imports the response, the self-signed certificate is
replaced by a chain of certificates. At the bottom of the chain is the
certificate (reply) issued by the CA authenticating the subject's public
key. The next certificate in the chain is one that authenticates the
CA's public key. Usually, this is a self-signed certificate (that is, a
certificate from the CA authenticating its own public key) and the last
certificate in the chain.

In other cases, the CA can return a chain of certificates. In this
situation, the bottom certificate in the chain is the same (a
certificate signed by the CA, authenticating the public key of the key
entry), but the second certificate in the chain is a certificate signed
by a different CA, authenticating the public key of the CA to which you
sent the CSR. Then, the next certificate in the chain is a certificate
authenticating the second CA's key, and so on, until a self-signed root
certificate is reached. Each certificate in the chain (after the first)
thus authenticates the public key of the signer of the previous
certificate in the chain.

[[certificate-files]]

===== Certificate Files

During {productName} installation, a certificate is generated in Java
Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) format suitable for internal testing.
(The certificate is self-signed.) By default, {productName} stores
its certificate information in certificate databases in the
domain-dir``/config`` directory:

Keystore file::
  The `keystore.jks` file contains {productName} certificate,
  including its private key. The keystore file is protected with a
  password. +
  Each keystore entry has a unique alias. After installation, the
  {productName} keystore has a single entry with an alias of `s1as`.
Truststore file::
  The `cacerts.jks` file contains the {productName} trusted
  certificates, including public keys for other entities. For a trusted
  certificate, the server has confirmed that the public key in the
  certificate belongs to the certificate's owner. Trusted certificates
  generally include those of CAs.

By default, {productName} is configured with a keystore and
truststore that will work with the example applications and for
development purposes.

[[secure-sockets-layer]]

===== Secure Sockets Layer

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the most popular standard for securing
Internet communications and transactions. Secure web applications use
HTTPS (HTTP over SSL). The HTTPS protocol uses certificates to ensure
confidential and secure communications between server and clients. In an
SSL connection, both the client and the server encrypt data before
sending it. Data is decrypted upon receipt.

When a Web browser (client) wants to connect to a secure site, an SSL
handshake happens, like this:

1. The browser sends a message over the network requesting a secure
session (typically, by requesting a URL that begins with `https` instead
of `http`).
2. The server responds by sending its certificate (including its public key).
3. The browser verifies that the server's certificate is valid and is
signed by a CA whose certificate is in the browser's database (and who
is trusted). It also verifies that the CA certificate has not expired.
4. If the certificate is valid, the browser generates a one time,
unique session key and encrypts it with the server's public key. The
browser then sends the encrypted session key to the server so that they
both have a copy.
5. The server decrypts the message using its private key and recovers
the session key.

After the handshake, the client has verified the identity of the Web
site, and only the client and the Web server have a copy of the session
key. From this point forward, the client and the server use the session
key to encrypt all their communications with each other. Thus, their
communications are ensured to be secure.

The newest version of the SSL standard is called Transport Layer
Security (TLS). The {productName} supports the SSL 3.0 and the TLS
1.0 encryption protocols.

To use SSL, {productName} must have a certificate for each external
interface or IP address that accepts secure connections. The HTTPS
service of most web servers will not run unless a certificate has been
installed. For instructions on applying SSL to HTTP listeners, see
"xref:administration-guide.adoc#to-configure-an-http-listener-for-ssl[
To Configure an HTTP Listener for SSL]" in {productName} Administration Guide.

[[ciphers]]

====== Ciphers

A cipher is a cryptographic algorithm used for encryption or decryption.
SSL and TLS protocols support a variety of ciphers used to authenticate
the server and client to each other, transmit certificates, and
establish session keys.

Some ciphers are stronger and more secure than others. Clients and
servers can support different cipher suites. During a secure connection,
the client and the server agree to use the strongest cipher that they
both have enabled for communication, so it is usually sufficient to
enable all ciphers.

[[name-based-virtual-hosts]]

====== Name-based Virtual Hosts

Using name-based virtual hosts for a secure application can be
problematic. This is a design limitation of the SSL protocol itself. The
SSL handshake, where the client browser accepts the server certificate,
must occur before the HTTP request is accessed. As a result, the request
information containing the virtual host name cannot be determined prior
to authentication, and it is therefore not possible to assign multiple
certificates to a single IP address.

If all virtual hosts on a single IP address need to authenticate against
the same certificate, the addition of multiple virtual hosts probably
will not interfere with normal SSL operations on the server. Be aware,
however, that most browsers will compare the server's domain name
against the domain name listed in the certificate, if any (applicable
primarily to official, CA-signed certificates). If the domain names do
not match, these browsers display a warning. In general, only
address-based virtual hosts are commonly used with SSL in a production
environment.

[[custom-authentication-of-client-certificate-in-ssl-mutual-authentication]]

===== Custom Authentication of Client Certificate in SSL Mutual Authentication

Release {productMajorVersion} of {productName} extends the Certificate realm to allow
custom authentication and group assignment based on the client
certificate received as part of SSL mutual (two-way) authentication.

As in previous releases, you can create only one certificate realm.
However, you can now use a convenient abstract base class to configure a
JAAS LoginModule for the Certificate realm. Specifically, your
LoginModule can now extend
`com.sun.appserv.security.AppservCertificateLoginModule`. When you do
this, you need to implement only the `authenticateUser` method and call
the `commitUserAuthentication` method to signify success.

This section describes the following topics:

* xref:#understanding-the-appservcertificateloginmodule-class[Understanding the `AppservCertificateLoginModule` Class]
* xref:#example-appservcertificateloginmodule-code[Example AppservCertificateLoginModule Code]
* xref:#setting-the-jaas-context[Setting the JAAS Context]

[[understanding-the-appservcertificateloginmodule-class]]

Understanding the `AppservCertificateLoginModule` Class

The `AppservCertificateLoginModule` class provides some convenience
methods for accessing the certificates, the application name and so
forth, and for adding the group principals to the subject. The
convenience methods include the following:

`getAppName()`::
  Returns the name of the application to be authenticated. This may be
  useful when a single LoginModule has to handle multiple applications
  that use certificates.
`getCerts()`::
  Returns the certificate chain as an array of
  `java.security.cert.X509Certificate` certificates.
`getX500Principal()`::
  Returns the Distinguished principal from the first certificate in the
  chain.
`getSubject()`::
  Returns the subject that is being authenticated.
`commitUserAuthentication(final String[] groups)`::
  This method sets the authentication status to success if the groups
  parameter is non-null. Note that this method is called after the
  authentication has succeeded. If authentication failed, do not call
  this method.

[NOTE]
====
You do not have to extend the convenience base class, you can extend the
JAAS LoginModule `javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule` instead if you so
choose.
====

[[example-appservcertificateloginmodule-code]]

Example AppservCertificateLoginModule Code

xref:#gksel[Example 1-1] shows a sample instance of the
AppservCertificateLoginModule class.

Take note of the following points from the example:

* The `getX500Principal()` method returns the subject (subject
distinguished name) value from the first certificate in the client
certificate chain as an `X500Principal`.
* From that `X500Principal`, the `getName()` method then returns a
string representation of the X.500 distinguished name using the format
defined in RFC 2253.
* The example uses the `getAppName()` method to determine the
application name. It also determines the organizational unit (`OU`) from
the distinguished name.
* The example concatenates the application name with the value of `OU`,
and uses it as the group name in the `commitUserAuthentication` method.

[[gksel]]
Example 1-1 Sample AppservCertificateLoginModule Code

[source,java]
----
public class CertificateLM extends AppservCertificateLoginModule {

    @Override
    protected void authenticateUser() throws LoginException {
        // Get the distinguished name from the X500Principal.
        String dname = getX500Principal().getName();
        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(dname, "B \t\n\r\f,");
        while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {
            String next = st.nextToken();
            // Set the appname:OU as the group.
            // At this point, one has the application name and the DN of
            // the certificate. A suitable login decision can be made here.
            if (next.startsWith("OU=")) {
            commitUserAuthentication(new String[]{getAppName() + ":" + next.substring(3)});
                return;
            }
        }
        throw new LoginException("No OU found.");
    }
}

[[setting-the-jaas-context]]

====== Setting the JAAS Context

After you create your LoginModule, you must plug it in to a
jaas-context, which you then specify as a parameter to the certificate
realm in {productName}.

To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Specify a new jaas-context for the Certificate realm in the file
domain-dir``/config/login.conf``. For example, using the `CertificateLM`
class from xref:#example-appservcertificateloginmodule-code[Example AppservCertificateLoginModule Code]:
+
[source]
----
certRealm {
    com.sun.blogs.certificate.login.CertificateLM required;
};
----
2. Specify this jaas-context as a parameter to the `set` subcommand in the
`configs.config.server-config.security-service.auth-realm.certificate.property.jaas-context=`<jaas-context-name>
property. For example:
+
`asadmin>`
`set configs.config.server-config.security-service.auth-realm.certificate.property.jaas-context=certRealm`
+
`configs.config.server-config.security-service.auth-realm.certificate.property.jaas-context=certRealm`
+
`Command set executed successfully.`
3. Optionally, get the value you just set to make sure that it is correct.
+
`asadmin>`
`get configs.config.server-config.security-service.auth-realm.certificate.property.jaas-context`
+
`configs.config.server-config.security-service.auth-realm.certificate.property.jaas-context=certRealm`
+
`Command get executed successfully.`

[[administering-passwords]]

=== Administering Passwords

There are multiple ways to administer passwords. You can rely on
administrators to keep passwords secret and change the passwords
regularly. You can set up files for storing passwords so that `asadmin`
subcommands can access these files rather than having users type the
commands. You can encrypt passwords by setting up aliases so that
sensitive passwords are not visible in the `domain.xml` file.

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#to-change-the-master-password[To Change the Master Password]
* xref:#additional-considerations-for-the-start-instance-and-start-cluster-subcommands[Additional Considerations for the `start-instance` and

* xref:#administering-password-aliases[Administering Password Aliases]

[[to-change-the-master-password]]

==== To Change the Master Password

The master password gives access to the keystore used with the domain.
This password is not tied to a UNIX user. You should treat this overall
shared password as sensitive data. {productName} never uses it for
authentication and never transmits it over the network.

You can choose to type the password manually when required, or to
obscure the password in a password file. If there is no password file,
you are prompted for the master password. If there is a password file,
but you want to change access to require prompting, remove the file. The
default master password is `changeit`.

When changing the master password, it has to be changed on all nodes as
well as on the DAS. The master password on nodes is only stored once in
the node, for all instances that are on that node.

Use the `change-master-password` subcommand in local mode to modify the
master password.

[NOTE]
====
If you change the master password and are not using a master password
file, the `start-instance` and `start-cluster` subcommands are not able
to determine the master password. In this case, you must start those
instances locally by using start-local-instance.
====

When the master password is saved, it is saved in the `master-password` file.

Before You Begin

This subcommand will not work unless the domain is stopped.

1. Stop the domain whose password you are changing.
+
See "xref:administration-guide.adoc#to-stop-a-domain[To Stop a Domain]"
in {productName} Administration Guide.
2. Change the master password for the domain by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#change-master-password[`change-master-password`] subcommand.
+
You are prompted for the old and new passwords. All dependent items are re-encrypted.
3. Start the domain.
+
See "xref:administration-guide.adoc#to-start-a-domain[To Start a Domain]" in {productName} Administration Guide.

[[givil]]
Example 1-2 Changing the Master Password

The `change-master-password` subcommand is interactive in that you are
prompted for the old master password as well as the new master password.
This example changes the master password for `domain44ps`:

[source]
----
asadmin> change-master-password domain44ps
----

If you have already logged into the domain using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#login[`login`] subcommand, you are prompted for the new
master password:

[source]
----
Please enter the new master password>
Please enter the new master password again>
----

If you are not logged into the domain, you are prompted for both the old
and the new master passwords:

[source]
----
Please enter the master password>
Please enter the new master password>
Please enter the new master password again>
----

Information similar to the following is displayed:

[source]
----
Master password changed for domain44ps
----

You can also view the full syntax and options of the subcommand by
typing `asadmin --help change-master-password` at the command line.

[[additional-considerations-for-the-start-instance-and-start-cluster-subcommands]]

==== Additional Considerations for the `start-instance` and `start-cluster` Subcommands

If you change the master password for DAS, the `start-domain` and
`start-local-instance` subcommands allow you to provide it during domain
or instance startup in one of three ways:

* Via the master-password file
* By entering it interactively
* Via the `asadmin` `passwordfile`

The `start-instance` and `start-cluster` subcommands are more
problematic. If you create a domain with a master password other than
the default, an associated remote instance or cluster must have access
to the master password in order to start. However, for security reasons
{productName} never transmits the master password or the master
password file over the network.

Consider the following scenario:

1. Change the master password on the DAS and save it with `--savemasterpassword`.
2. Create an instance on another host using the subcommand
`create-instance`. {productName} copies the keystore and truststore
from the DAS to the instance, but it does not copy the master password file.
3. Try to start the instance using the `start-instance` subcommand.
An error results.

The `start-instance` command is looking for the file master-password in
the node directory on the instance machine, and it is not there by
default. Therefore, the subcommand fails.

You can use the `change-master-password` subcommand to make sure the
correct password is used in this password file, as described in
xref:#using-start-instance-and-start-cluster-with-a-password-file[Using `start-instance` and `start-cluster` With a Password File].

[NOTE]
====
The `start-instance` and `start-cluster` subcommands do not include any
other way for you to provide the password. If you change the master
password and are not using a master password file, the `start-instance`
and `start-cluster` subcommands are not able to determine the master
password. In this case, you must start the instances locally by using
`start-local-instance`.
====

[[using-start-instance-and-start-cluster-with-a-password-file]]

==== Using `start-instance` and `start-cluster` With a Password File

Assume that you have changed the master password on the DAS and you want
to make the same change for all instances.

The `start-instance` and `start-cluster` subcommands automatically use
the master password file if it exists in the instance filesystem. You
can use the `change-master-password` subcommand to make sure the
password file exists and that the correct password is used.

1. From the DAS, create a domain and set the master password. +
`asadmin> create-domain --savemasterpassword true domain-name`
2. Start the domain. +
`asadmin> start-domain domain-name`
3. Create a node that is enabled for communication over secure shell (SSH). +
`asadmin> create-node-ssh --nodehost host-name --installdir/some-dir node-name`
4. Create an instance on the node. +
`asadmin> create-instance --node node-name instance-name`
5. Before you start the instance, on the instance machine run
`change-master-password` with the `---savemasterpassword` option to
create a file called `master-password` in the agents directory to access
the keystores. (The `start-instance` subcommand is looking for a file
called `master-password` in the agents directory to access the stores.) +
`asadmin> change-master-password --savemasterpassword true --nodedir /some-dir node-name` +
You are prompted to enter the current and new master password:
+
[source]
----
Enter the current master password>
Enter the new master password>
Enter the new master password again>
Command change-master-password executed successfully.
----
+
Remember that when you created the domain you specified a new master
password. This master password was then used to encrypt the keystore and
truststore for the DAS, and these stores were copied to the instance as
a result of the `create-instance` subcommand.
+
Therefore, enter the master password you set when you created the domain
as both the current master password and again as the new master
password. You enter it as the new master password because you do not
want to change the master password for the instance and make it out of
sync with the DAS.
6. Run start-instance from the DAS.
+
`asadmin>` `start-instance` instance-name
+
The master password file is associated with the node and not with an
instance. After the master password file exists in the node directory on
the instance machine, additional instances can be created, started and
stopped from the DAS.

[[to-change-an-administration-password]]

==== To Change an Administration Password

Use the `change-admin-password` subcommand in remote mode to change an
administration password. The default administration user is `admin`. You
are prompted for the old and new admin passwords, with confirmation. The
passwords are not echoed to the display.

[NOTE]
====
For the zip bundle of {productName} {productMajorVersion}, the default administrator
login is `admin`, with no password, which means that no login is
required. For {productName}, you are prompted to provide a
password for the `admin` user when you start the domain for the first
time.
====

[NOTE]
====
If there is a single user called `admin` that does not have a password,
you are not prompted for login information. Any other situation requires
login.
====

[NOTE]
====
If secure administration is enabled as described in
xref:administrative-security.adoc#running-secure-admin[Running Secure Admin], you cannot
change an administration password to a blank value.
====


Encrypting the admin password is strongly encouraged.

1. Change the admin password by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#change-admin-password[`change-admin-password`] subcommand.
2. Enter the old and new admin passwords when prompted.
3. Restart {productName}. +
See "xref:administration-guide.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart a Domain]" in {productName} Administration Guide.

[[ghlac]]
Example 1-3 Changing the Admin Password

This example changes the admin password for user anonymous from
`adminadmin` to `newadmin`:

----

You are prompted to enter the old and the new admin passwords:

[source]
----
Enter admin password>adminadmin
Enter new admin password>newadmin

----

Information similar to the following is displayed:

[source]
----
Command change-admin-password executed successfully.
----

You can also view the full syntax and options of the subcommand by
typing `asadmin help change-admin-password` at the command line.

[[to-set-a-password-from-a-file]]

==== To Set a Password From a File

Instead of typing the password at the command line, you can access the
password for a command from a file such as `passwords.txt`. The
`--passwordfile` option of the `asadmin` utility takes the name of the
file that contains the passwords. The entry for a password in the file
must have the `AS_ADMIN_` prefix followed by the password name in
uppercase letters.

[NOTE]
====
Any password file created to pass as an argument by using the
`--passwordfile` argument to the `asadmin` utility should be protected
with file system permissions. Additionally, any password file being used
for a transient purpose, such as setting up SSH among nodes, should be
deleted after it has served its purpose.
====

For a list of the types of passwords that can be specified, see the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#asadmin[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.

[source]
----
AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD
AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD
AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
----

1. Edit the password file. +
For example, to specify the password for the domain administration
server (DAS), add an entry similar to the following to the password
file, where `adminadmin` is the administrator password:
+
[source]
----
AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminadmin
----
2. Save the password file. +
You can now specify the password file in an `asadmin` subcommand. In
this example, `passwords.txt` is the file that contains the password:
+
[source]
----
asadmin>delete-jdbc-resource --user admin --passwordfile passwords.txt jdbc/DerbyPool
----

===== Troubleshooting

If `AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` has been exported to the global environment,
specifying the `--passwordfile` option will produce a warning about
using the `--passwordfile` option. To prevent this warning situation
from happening, unset `AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

[[administering-password-aliases]]

==== Administering Password Aliases

A password alias is used to indirectly access a password so that the
password itself does not appear in cleartext in the domain's
`domain.xml` configuration file.

Storing passwords in cleartext format in system configuration files is
common in many open source projects. In addition to {productName},
Apache Tomcat, Maven, and Subversion, among others, store and pass
passwords in cleartext format. However, storing and passing passwords in
cleartext can be a security risk, and may violate some corporate
security policies. In such cases, you can use password aliases.

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#to-create-a-password-alias[To Create a Password Alias]
* xref:#to-list-password-aliases[To List Password Aliases]
* xref:#to-delete-a-password-alias[To Delete a Password Alias]
* xref:#to-update-a-password-alias[To Update a Password Alias]

[[to-create-a-password-alias]]

===== To Create a Password Alias

Use the `create-password-alias` subcommand in remote mode to create an
alias for a password in the domain's keystore. The password
corresponding to the alias name is stored in an encrypted form in the
domain configuration file. The `create-password-alias` subcommand takes
both a secure interactive form, in which users are prompted for all
information, and a more script-friendly form, in which the password is
propagated on the command line.

You can also use the xref:reference-manual.adoc#set[`set`] subcommand to remove and
replace the password in the configuration file. For example:

[source]
----
asadmin set --user admin server.jms-service.jms-host.default_JMS_host.
admin-password='${ALIAS=jms-password}'
----

1. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
2. Go to the directory where the configuration file resides. +
By default, the configuration file is located in domain-dir``/config``.
3. Create the password alias by using the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-password-alias[`create-password-alias`] subcommand.
4. Type the password for the alias when prompted.
5. Add the alias to a password file. +
For example, assume the use of a password file such as `passwords.txt`.
Assume further that you want to add an alias for the
`AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD` entry that is read by the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-file-user[`create-file-user`] subcommand.
You would add the following line to the password file:
`AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD=${ALIAS=user-password-alias}`, where
user-password-alias is the new password alias.
6. To continue the example of the previous step, you would then run the
xref:reference-manual.adoc#create-file-user[`create-file-user`] subcommand. +
You could use this method to create several users (user1, user2, and so forth),
all with the same password. +
`asadmin>` `--passwordfile``passwords.txt create-file-user` user1

=== Administering JSSE Certificates

In the developer profile, the {productName} {productMajorVersion} uses the JSSE format
on the server side to manage certificates and key stores. In all
profiles, the client side (appclient or stand-alone) uses the JSSE
format.

The Java SE SDK ships with the `keytool` utility, which enables you to
set up and work with Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) digital
certificates. You can administer public/private key pairs and associated
certificates, and cache the public keys (in the form of certificates) of
their communicating peers.

The following topics are addressed here:

* xref:#to-generate-a-certificate-by-using-keytool[To Generate a Certificate by Using `keytool`]
* xref:#to-sign-a-certificate-by-using-keytool[To Sign a Certificate by Using `keytool`]
* xref:#to-delete-a-certificate-by-using-keytool[To Delete a Certificate by Using `keytool`]

[[to-generate-a-certificate-by-using-keytool]]

==== To Generate a Certificate by Using `keytool`

By default, the `keytool` utility creates a keystore file in the
directory where the utility is run.

Before You Begin

To run the `keytool` utility, your shell environment must be configured
so that the Java SE ``/bin`` directory is in the path, otherwise the full
path to the utility must be present on the command line.

1. Change to the directory that contains the keystore and truststore files. +
Always generate the certificate in the directory containing the keystore
and truststore files. The default is domain-dir``/config``.
2. Generate the certificate in the keystore file, `keystore.jks`, using
the following command format:
+
[source]
----
keytool -genkey -alias keyAlias-keyalg RSA
 -keypass changeit
 -storepass changeit
keystore keystore.jks
----
Use any unique name as your keyAlias. If you have changed the keystore
or private key password from the default (`changeit`), substitute the
new password for `changeit`. The default key password alias is `s1as`.
+
A prompt appears that asks for your name, organization, and other information.
3. Export the generated certificate to the `server.cer` file (or
`client.cer` if you prefer), using the following command format:
+
[source]
----
keytool -export -alias keyAlias-storepass changeit
 -file server.cer
 -keystore keystore.jks
----
4. If a certificate signed by a certificate authority is required, see
xref:#to-sign-a-certificate-by-using-keytool[To Sign a Certificate by Using `keytool`].
5. Create the `cacerts.jks` truststore file and add the certificate to
the truststore, using the following command format:
+
[source]
----
keytool -import -v -trustcacerts
-alias keyAlias
 -file server.cer
-keystore cacerts.jks
 -keypass changeit
----
If you have changed the keystore or private key password from the
default (`changeit`), substitute the new password.
+
Information about the certificate is displayed and a prompt appears
asking if you want to trust the certificate.
6. Type `yes`, then press Enter.
+
Information similar to the following is displayed:
+
[source]
----
Certificate was added to keystore

[[to-sign-a-certificate-by-using-keytool]]

==== To Sign a Certificate by Using `keytool`

After creating a certificate, the owner must sign the certificate to
prevent forgery. E-commerce sites, or those for which authentication of
identity is important, can purchase a certificate from a well-known
Certificate Authority (CA).


[NOTE]
====
If authentication is not a concern, for example if private secure
communications are all that is required, you can save the time and
expense involved in obtaining a CA certificate by using a self-signed
certificate.
====


1. Delete the default self-signed certificate:
+
[source]
----
keytool -delete -alias s1as -keystore keystore.jks -storepass <store_passwd>
----
where <store_passwd> is the password for the keystore. For example,
"mypass". Note that `s1as` is the default alias of the {productName}
keystore.
2. Generate a new key pair for the application server:
+
[source]
----
keytool -genkeypair -keyalg <key_alg> -keystore keystore.jks
-validity <val_days> -alias s1as
----
where <key_alg> is the algorithm to be used for generating the key pair,
for example RSA, and <val_days> is the number of days that the
certificate should be considered valid. For example, 365.
+
In addition to generating a key pair, the command wraps the public key
into a self-signed certificate and stores the certificate and the
private key in a new keystore entry identified by the alias.
+
For HTTPS hostname verification, it is important to ensure that the name
of the certificate (CN) matches the fully-qualified hostname of your
site (fully-qualified domain name). If the names do not match, clients
connecting to the server will see a security alert stating that the name
of the certificate does not match the name of the site.
3. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):
+
[source]
----
keytool -certreq -alias s1as -file <certreq_file> -keystore keystore.jks
-storepass <store_passwd>
----
where <certreq_file> is the file in which the CSR is stored (for
example, `s1as.csr`) and <store_passwd> is the password for the
keystore. For example, changeit.
4. Submit the CSR to a Certificate Authority such as VeriSign (at
`http://www.verisign.com/ssl/buy-ssl-certificates/index.html`). In
response, you should receive a signed server certificate. Make sure to
import into your browser the CA certificate of the CA (if not already
present) and any intermediate certificates indicated by the CA in the
reply.
5. Store the signed server certificate from the CA, including the
markers `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`,
into a file such as `s1as.cert`. Download the CA certificate and any
intermediate CA certificates and store them in local files.
6. Import the CA certificate (if not already present) and any
intermediate CA certificates (if not already present) indicated by the
CA into the truststore `cacerts.jks`:
+
[source]
----
keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias <CA-Name> -file ca.cert
 -keystore cacerts.jks -storepass <store_passwd>
----
7. Replace the original self-signed certificate with the certificate
you obtained from the CA, as stored in a file such as `s1as.cert`:
+
[source]
----
keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias s1as -file s1as.cert
   -keystore keystore.jks -storepass <store_passwd>
----
When you import the certificate using the same original alias `s1as`,
keytool treats it as a command to replace the original certificate with
the certificate obtained as a reply to a CSR.
+
After running the command, you should see that the certificate `s1as` in
the keystore is no longer the original self-signed certificate, but is
now the response certificate from the CA.
+
Consider the following example that compares an original `s1as`
certificate with a new `s1as` certificate obtained from VeriSign:
+
[source]
----
Original s1as (self-signed):

Example 1-15 Importing an RFC/Text-Formatted Certificate Into a JKS
Keystore

Certificates are often stored using the printable encoding format
defined by the Internet Request for Comments (RFC) 1421 standard instead
of their binary encoding. This certificate format, also known as Base 64
encoding, facilitates exporting certificates to other applications by
email or through some other mechanism.

=== Administering JACC Providers

The Java Authorization Contract for Containers (JACC) is part of the
J2EE 1.4 specification that defines an interface for pluggable
authorization providers. This enables the administrator to set up
third-party plug-in modules to perform authorization.

{productName} includes Administration Console support and subcommands
to support JACC providers, as follows:

* create `create-jacc-provider`
* delete `delete-jacc-provider`
* list `list-jacc-providers`

The default {productName} installation includes two JACC providers,
named default and simple. You should not delete these default providers.
Any JACC providers you create with the `create-jacc-provider` subcommand
are in addition to these two default providers.

The {productName} creates a JSR-115-compliant JACC provider that you
can use with third-party authorization modules for applications running
in {productName}. The JACC provider is created as a `jacc-provider`
element within the security-service element in the domain's `domain.xml`
file.
