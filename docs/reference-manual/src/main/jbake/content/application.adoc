server-side Java applications and web services

[[sthref2392]]

Description

The Java EE platform enables applications to access systems that are
outside of the application server. Applications connect to these systems
through resources. The \{product---name} infrastructure supports the
deployment of many types of distributed applications and is an ideal
foundation for building applications based on Service Oriented
Architectures (SOA). SOA is a design methodology aimed at maximizing the
reuse of application services. These features enable you to run scalable
and highly available Java EE applications.
