=== Description

The `delete-config` subcommand deletes an existing named configuration
from the configuration of the domain administration server (DAS). You
can delete a configuration only if no {productName} instances or
clusters refer to the configuration. A standalone configuration is
automatically deleted when the instance or cluster that refers to it is
deleted. You cannot delete the `default-config` configuration that is
copied to create standalone configurations.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
