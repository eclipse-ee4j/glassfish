/**
 * iAS JAAS LoginModule for an LDAP Realm.
 *
 * <P>
 * Refer to the LDAPRealm documentation for necessary and optional configuration parameters for the iAS LDAP login support.
 *
 * <P>
 * There are various ways in which a user can be authenticated using an LDAP directory. Currently this login module only supports
 * one mode, 'find and bind'. Other modes may be added as schedules permit.
 *
 * <P>
 * Mode: <i>find-bind</i>
 * <ol>
 * <li>An LDAP search is issued on the directory starting at base-dn with the given search-filter (having substituted the user
 * name in place of %s). If no entries match this search, login fails and authentication is over.
 * <li>The DN of the entry which matched the search as the DN of the user in the directory. If the search-filter is properly set
 * there should always be a single match; if there are multiple matches, the first one found is used.
 * <li>Next an LDAP bind is attempted using the above DN and the provided password. If this fails, login is considered to have
 * failed and authentication is over.
 * <li>Then an LDAP search is issued on the directory starting at group-base-dn with the given group-search-filter (having
 * substituted %d for the user DN previously found). From the matched entry(ies) all the values of group-target are taken as
 * group names in which the user has membership. If no entries are found, the group membership is empty.
