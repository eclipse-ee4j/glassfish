=== Synopsis

[source]
----
asadmin [asadmin-options] multimode [--help]
[--file filename]
[--printprompt={true|false}] [--encoding encode]
----

[[sthref1901]]

=== Description

The `multimode` subcommand processes `asadmin` subcommands sequentially
in a single session. The command-line interface prompts for a
subcommand, runs that subcommand, displays the results of that
subcommand, and then prompts for the next subcommand. All the `asadmin`
options set in multimode apply to subsequent commands until the
multimode session is exited. You exit `multimode` by typing `exit`,
`quit`, or Ctrl-D.

You can use the `export` subcommand to set your environment, or use the
`unset` subcommand to remove environment variables from the multimode
environment.

You can also provide subcommands by passing a previously prepared list
of subcommands from a file or standard input (pipe). When you use a
file, you can include comment lines in the file by entering the hash
symbol (`#`) as the first character of the line.

You can invoke `multimode` from within a multimode session. When you
exit the second multimode environment, you return to your original
multimode environment.

All the remote `asadmin` utility options can be supplied when invoking
the `multimode` subcommand. The settings will apply as defaults for all
subcommands that are run within the multimode session. For a list of the
`asadmin` utility options, see the
link:asadmin.html#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.
